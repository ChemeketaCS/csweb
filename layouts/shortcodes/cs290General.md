## General

* Carefully read the submission instructions in Elearn. You generally will have
to push your code to GitHub and do an assignment submission in Elearn.  
* I will not fix one part of your project so that I can test another. If something is
completely broken, leave/comment it out.  
* Readability and maintainability of your code count.  Style/formatting is not awarded
points, but lack of it may result in a deduction on any assignment.
* Unless noted otherwise, it is always fine to add extra .css and .js files to support
the web pages you are building. Failing to do this and copy/pasting the same code into
multiple files in a project will likely be a style deduction.
