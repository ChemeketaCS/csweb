## General

* Submit all files to elearn. Make sure to name file(s) **EXACTLY** as specified - including
capitalization. Do not zip or otherwise package/compress files unless told to.
* Make sure your program accepts input in **EXACTLY** the order and format given.
Do not ask for extra input or change the order of inputs.  
*If you want to make an expanded version of a program that and get feedback on it,
email it to me or show me in class.*
* Slight variations in output wording/formatting are usually fine
(as long as formatting isn't part of the assignment).  
If you do not get the right final output, print out some evidence of the work your program
did to demonstrate your progress.
* Readability and maintainability of your code counts. Poor formatting, confusing variable names,
unnecessarily complex code, etcâ€¦ will all result in deductions to your score.
* Every file you submit should have a comment like this at the top:
   ``` 
   /**
   * @brief Assignment 1 
   * @name YOUR NAME
   */
   ```
