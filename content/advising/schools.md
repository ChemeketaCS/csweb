Below are notes about the most popular transfer targets for Chemeketa students and tips about them.

## Western Oregon University

Western Oregon is a liberal arts focused school and the [CS department](https://wou.edu/cs/) is part
of the general college of letters and sciences. Thus the CS program has more of a software focus
and less emphasis on hardware and computer engineering level issues. Because it is a smaller,
teaching focused university, you can expect small classes and a more personal experience.

For those who are mathematically inclined, WOU offers a double degree in CS and Math.

### WOU Transfer Tips

* Students going to WOU may chose to take MTH 231 and 232 instead of MTH112, 251, and 252.
(see page 12 of the CS MTM).
* Take CS205 - it transfers as CS271 which is required by WOU.

## OSU

The [OSU CS program](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/future-students/undergraduates/computer-science)
is based in the engineering department. It has a larger number of required technical CS courses
and more extensive math requirements. Because it is a large, research focused university, there
are an extensive options to study different topics in CS. However, you should be prepared for
large classes and a demanding academic environment.

### OSU Transfer Tips

* Take CS290.
* Try to make sure one of your social science courses meets OSU's
    [Difference, Power, and Discrimination requirement](https://catalog.oregonstate.edu/earning-degrees/bcc/#text).
* If you have room to take any of these courses, do so to make things easier after transfer:
    * Both WR 227 and 122
    * ENGR214 (Transfers as Stats 314)
    * HPE 295 or 3 credits of PE
* Some applied options will require extra math courses. If you are going to need
    MTH 253 and/or MTH 254 you would be wise to take them while 251/252 are still fresh
    in your mind.

### OSU Degree Options

#### Applied Option

The [OSU Applied CS](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/future-students/undergraduates/computer-science) 
option allows students to develop a degree program that focuses on their area of
interest. You chose or design a "mini-minor" of related courses to take with your CS core.
Sample applied programs include Business and Entrepreneurship, Bioinformatics, Game and
Simulation Development, and Human Computer Interaction.

#### Systems Option

The systems option is essentially a mini-minor in electrical engineering. This degree is
ABET (Accreditation Board of Engineering & Technology) accredited - if you want a job
with a hardware focused company like Intel or Garmin, this would be the option to chose.

The CS MTM prepares students for the Applied degree option. To prepare for the Systems
Option, you should:

* Continue taking math through 254
* Take Physics 211-213 as your science courses
* Don't take CS205 - instead you will need to take ENGR 271/272 at OSU in the summer before
    Jr year or fall of Jr year.

## OSU Cascades

The [Bend campus of OSU CS program](https://osucascades.edu/academics/computer-science)
has a focus in Software Engineering. You should prepare for it in the same way as the OSU
Corvallis Applied CS degree. See the **Transfer Tips** listed above.

## PSU

PSU has a large [CS program](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/bachelor-of-science-program)
with many research/study areas. Like OSU, PSU is a large research university. Which
means lots of course options, but larger classes.

Since it is located in downtown Portland, PSU has a very different feel than the other
Oregon universities. Its proximity to the tech industry in Portland means there
are a wide variety of local internship opportunities.

### PSU Transfer Tips

Taking the following courses can eliminate requirements that otherwise need to get
done at PSU:
* MTH253
* An additional science elective from Bio, Chem, Phys, Geol, or Environmental Science
* An additional Arts and Letters or Social Science elective (from the AAOT approved
    courses)

## University of Oregon

[U of O's CS program](https://cs.uoregon.edu/prospective-students) is called Computer
Information Science - but it is very much a CS program, not an Information Systems one.
It is not part of an engineering school - although you will be exposed to engineering
related topics, there is more of a focus on theoretical and applied computer science.
But, like OSU and PSU, it is a large research campus. Expect lots of options to
study advanced topics in a more demanding academic environment.

U of O will accept Geology 201-203 as a science sequence (instead of physics, biology,
or chemistry).

University of Oregon require B's or better in lower division CS work (100/200 level). If you have
a C in one or more CS classes you will need to petition to avoid retaking them at U of O.

## Oregon Tech

Oregon Tech (formerly OIT) offers a Software Engineering Bachelor's degree. Most students from
Chemeketa focus on the [Software Engineering program](https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/software-engineering-technology),
but there are also programs in
[Embedded Systems](https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/embedded-systems-engineering-technology)
and [Data Science](https://www.oit.edu/academics/degrees/data-science).

As the state's technical university, it is very focused on producing working software
engineers - expect a significant number of classes that focus on practical software
development. That said, it is an accredited
engineering program - you need an extensive amount of math and must take the calculus
based physics.

Oregon Tech has two campuses. The one close by in Wilsonville offers a program that
is more focused on working students. It is a non-residential campus and many of the classes
are offered at night or on weekends. The Klamath Falls campus offers a more traditional
college environment (day classes, dorms, etc...).

The CS MTM does NOT guarantee Junior standing and a path to graduate in two more years at
Oregon Tech. However, if you select courses carefully, it is possible to transfer there
and finish on time.

Oregon Tech students normally take some classes we do not offer during their first two years.
Because a few of those will be required to start your Jr year, it is **highly** recommended you
dual enroll by your second year so you can take some of those classes and get degree
advice from an Oregon Tech advisor.

### Oregon Tech Transfer Tips

* Do the OSU/PSU/UofO variant of the MTM with the modifications listed below
    * Take Physics 211-213 as your science
    * Take Psychology 201 as one of your Social Science courses
    * Do NOT take MTH 231/232 or CS 205
* Take CST236 and/or CST238 at Oregon Tech in either Spring or Summer before transferring.
    You need one of these two done to start the Junior year.

## EOU

[Eastern Oregon CS](https://www.eou.edu/computer-science/)
offers a fully online CS degree as well as an in-person degree at their La Grande campus.
