## Identify your discipline

Make sure you know the difference between [Computer Engineering (CE), Computer Science (CS),
Software Engineering (SE), Information Technology (IT), and Information Systems (IS)](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/ComputingFields/index.html).

* If you are interested in **CS or SE** and a career as a software developer or computer scientist,
    you are in the right place!

* If you are interested in **CE**,
    you should check out the [Engineering Department](https://www.chemeketa.edu/programs-classes/program-finder/engineering/).

* If you are interested in an **IT or IS** degree you should talk to the
[CIS Department](https://www.chemeketa.edu/programs-classes/program-finder/computer-information-systems/).

## Pick a Plan of Study

### Computer Science Major Transfer Map

Most students interested in earning a degree in Computer Science should work towards
the [Major Transfer Map in Computer Science](https://www.oregon.gov/highered/policy-collaboration/Documents/Transfer-Credit/2998/Statewide%20Articulation%20Agreement,%20Major%20Transfer%20Map%20in%20Computer%20Science.pdf).
Completing the Major Transfer Map (MTM) will allow you to enroll as a Junior in a CS program at
any of the Oregon Universities except for Oregon Tech. Completing the MTM guarantees that
you will have a two year path to finish a CS degree after transferring.

The CS Major Transfer Map is brand new for this academic year. If you are an existing student
who was  working on the ASOT-CS or AAOT, you can either switch your focus to the MTM or
continue working on your existing degree plan.

If you have not taken any science courses yet, or are planning on going to WOU, it will
likely be easy to switch to the MTM. If you are planning on going to OSU and have started
taking science courses that are not part of one of the sequences outlined in the MTM, switching
plans might not make sense. You will still be able to transfer just like before with the
ASOT-CS degree - as long as you complete the courses listed on the advising pages (3 & 4)
you will be on track to start Junior year and complete on time.

Universities will not begin accepting the MTM for transfer until Fall 2022. If you are
planning on starting at a university before then, you will need to focus on
completing the ASOT-CS and any extra courses required by your target university.

Although the MTM does make it easy to complete the first two years of a CS degree at Chemeketa,
there are a few important details to watch out for:

* There are two variants of the MTM for CS. One targets OSU, PSU and UofO.
    The other targets WOU, EOU, and SOU. The OSU/PSU/UofO variant requires more
    courses - so if you focus on it, you will also be in good shape for WOU/EOU/SOU.
    On the other hand, if you focus on WOU/EOU/SOU and then change your mind, you will
    need to get extra courses done. For the most part, you can wait until you are starting
    your second year to decide which variant to focus on.
* Don't sign up for science classes until you decide which MTM variant you want to do. If
    you do the OSU/PSU/UofO track you need to take a sequence of specific science courses.
* Every school has a minimum GPA (2-2.25) required to transfer in. Some schools require a B
    or better in some/all CS courses (SOU & UofO).
* Every school requires two terms in a foreign language (the same language), or two years
    of the same language in high school.
* Oregon State has a Systems Option that has additional requirements. It is for students
    who are interested in a hardware/low-level computing focused degree. Talk to a CS
    faculty member for advice about it.

### Other Degrees

Students can also earn either an [ASOT-CS degree](https://www.chemeketa.edu/media/content-assets/documents/pdf/degrees/ASOT---CS-Degree-Requirements-and-Advising-Guide.pdf)
or [AAOT](https://www.chemeketa.edu/programs-classes/degrees/) degree. These degrees do NOT guarantee
that you will start as a Junior in the CS major or have a path to finish in two more years.
They only guarantee that your general education requirements are done and, in the case
of the ASOT-CS, that you probably have taken important CS courses you will need.
Hence, the CS Major Transfer map is generally a better "deal" for transfer students.

The ASOT-CS lists CS271 as being required for some schools - that  has been replaced by CS205.
