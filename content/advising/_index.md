## Identify your discipline

Make sure you know the difference between [Computer Engineering (CE), Computer Science (CS),
Software Engineering (SE), Information Technology (IT), and Information Systems (IS)](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/ComputingFields/index.html).

* If you are interested in **CS or SE**, you are in the right place!

* If you are interested in **CE** you should talk to
[Mark Miller](mailto:mark.miller@chemeketa.edu) from the
[Engineering Department](https://www.chemeketa.edu/programs-classes/program-finder/engineering/).

* If you are interested in a technically focused **IT or IS** degree, you should talk to
[Mandy Reininger](mailto:mandy.reininger@chemeketa.edu) from the
[CIS Department](https://www.chemeketa.edu/programs-classes/program-finder/computer-information-systems/).

* If you are interested in a business focused **IS** degree, you probably want to work on the
[ASOT-Business degree](https://www.chemeketa.edu/programs-classes/degrees/) and transfer into a
Business Information Systems program.

## Sign up for updates

Sign up for the [Computer Science mailing list](http://eepurl.com/bhlDT1) to receive news about
updates at the four-year universities as well as transfer related events and deadlines. You can
also view an [archive of past emails sent on the mailing list](https://us10.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=80c5b042ad9fa8e70edde9296&id=bd7a5c549ct).

## Schedule planning

Most students interested in earning a degree in Computer Science should work towards the
[ASOT-CS degree](https://www.chemeketa.edu/students/advising/advising-guides/) here at
Chemeketa. It is very similar to the standard AAOT transfer degree, but includes the CS and Math
courses you will need for a CS degree.

If you are interested in Western Oregon University, you do not need to take MTH 112, 251 or 252 -
that means you will end up earning the AAOT. But you should still follow the guidance on the
ASOT-CS degree for everything other than MTH 112/251/252.

You can use this [Mock Schedule builder](http://localhost:1313/advising/mock_schedule/) to explore 
what a schedule 2 year transfer schedule to different schools might look like.

Note that many schools require additional courses beyond the base ones included in the ASOT-CS.
Make sure to check the requirements of program(s) you are interested in. You can find these
requirements on pages 3 & 4 of the ASOT-CS degree and on the mock schedule builder.
