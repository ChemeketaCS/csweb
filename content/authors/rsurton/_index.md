## Remote Office Hours

While Chemeketa is doing remote instruction, I will be holding office hours in [Google Chat](http://chat.google.com/).
Use your Chemeketa account to sign in to [Google Chat](http://chat.google.com/) or [GMail](http://mail.google.com/) and start a conversation with me.
If our discussion would benefit from video, audio, or screen sharing, we will be able to drop into a meeting from there.
Whenever I am available for office hours, I will also be giving real-time answers via [email](mailto:robert.surton@chemeketa.edu).
