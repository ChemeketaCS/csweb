## Online Activity Outline

### Pointers and Objects

If you did not get to the pointer review last week, go do it first.

Read 11.10.

### Aggregation

Read [learncpp.com](http://www.learncpp.com/) Ch 16.3 for the ideas behind
aggregationâ€”don't worry too much about the Teacher/Department sample
they use; though the idea makes sense, their example is too stripped
down to be informative. (Book Ch10.8 also talks about it, but in a very
limited way).

Watch this first video. It focuses on the basics for this week's
assignment.

Do the Aggregation CPPLab.

This second video looks at using aggregation to model relationships
between people and to navigate those relationships. It should give you
an idea about how to attack parts of this weeks assignment.

### Using `this`

Read 11.11.

Watch this video on a couple tips about using `this`:

### Quiz

Quiz 1 will be open in elearn Thursday through Saturday. The topics
include weeks 1 and 2 (Ch 9/10 + Unit Testing & Test Driven Development).
You are not responsible for 10.1/10.2 (string stuff) on the quiz.

When studying for the quiz, you might find it useful to use the sample
questions from the book author's website, linked from the resources
page here.
