-   Take Quiz 3 online - covers weeks 5, 6 & 7

## Online Activity Outline

### Recursion Basics

Read 17.1-17.2. Watch this video:

{{< youtube videoid="d8QvYNoYLTA" title="Recursion Basics" >}}

Do the Recursion Practice WS from classroom files link. The key is
there as well.

### Recursion writing and helper functions

Read 17.3-17.5 and watch these two videos:

{{< youtube videoid="pTUDzu8RhVs" title="Thinking Recursively" >}}
{{< youtube videoid="8cXIu4Xx5j8" title="Example Recursive Algorithms" >}}

Do Recursion 1 CPPLab

### Tail Recursion & Tricky Applications

Read 17.6-17.9 and watch this video (hint: the flood fill sample is
very similar to the logic you need for assignment 8). Source code is
in the Github repository
