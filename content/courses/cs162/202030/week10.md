## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this week, you should be able to:

-   Use std::map to store data
-   Use std::algorithms

## Deadlines this week

-   Friday 11:59 Lists CPPLab
-   Friday 11:59 Sets/Maps CPPLab
-   Sat 11:59 Algorithms CPPLab
-   Sat 11:59PM - Quiz 4 open in elearn Thurs-Sat covering weeks 8-10
-   Sunday 11:59 - Assignment 8. Late work will not be accepted for the final assignment.

## Suggested pacing

### Day 1

-   Std::List
-   Review (from online supplemental chapter) 22.1, 22.2, 22.5.
-   Do Std::List CPPLab

### Day 2

-   Sets & Maps
-   Read 22.6.1 - 22.6.2 on sets and maps
-   Do Set/Map CPPLab

### Day 3

-   Std::Algorithms
-   Read 23.1-23.3. Use the rest of Ch 23 as reference - don't
    worry about reading/memorizing them all, just get used to the
    kinds of things you can do.
-   Do Algorithms CPPLab

### Day 4

-   Study Hall
-   Take Quiz 4 Online

## Final Notes

Here are the big ideas you should feel confident writing code on/answering
questions about:

-   Objects & Composition
-   Inheritance, Polymorphism & Virtual Functions
-   Pointers & Shared memory
-   Container classes - especially memory management (copy ctor, destructor and assignment operator)
-   Templated functions/classes
-   Recursion

## Online Activity Outline

### STL Basics

The STL is a collection of generic (templated) largely focused on
storing and working with collections of data. Our goal for CS162 is
to learn about becoming consumers of data structures. As a practical
programmer in C++ (or Java, C#, etc...) if you want to store a
collection of things, a plain array is often not the best tool.
CS260 is largely about learning how the structures in the STL (and
similar libraries for other languages) are implemented and why those
implementations are used. But, most languages provide prebuilt
implementations of these structures - the STL is that library for
C++

Read your choice of [Learncpp.com 16.1-16.2], which is a good high
level overview, and/or Liang Ch 22.1-22.2, which gives a slightly more
detailed view.

### Lists

Read 22.5.

Do Lists CPPLab.

### Sets & Map

Read 22.6.1-22.6.2 on sets and maps. Watch this video:

{{< youtube videoid="4o4oFSxrq30" >}}

Do Maps/Sets CPPLab.

### STL Algorithms

Read [Learncpp.com 16.4] for a high level intro to STL algorithms.

  [Learncpp.com 16.4]: http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/16-1-the-standard-template-library-stl/

Do the Ch23 reading (23.1-23.2, skim the rest as you do CPPLabs).

{{< youtube videoid="WckRmNPUFvE" >}}

Do Algorithms CPPLab.

Don't forget to take the final quiz!

There is a great [algorithm reference] at cplusplus.com, with examples
of different algorithms in use.
