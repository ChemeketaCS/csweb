## Learning objectives

-   Design classes to represent data types in C++
-   Construct and read UML class diagrams
-   Write basic object oriented programs using common design principles

## Deadlines this week

-   Wed 11:59PM - Background Survey and Class Policies Review in eLearn.
    The review is scored as an assignment. The survey is not graded, but
    if you do not complete it you will be given a 0 on the Class
    Policies Review.
-   Thurs 11:59PM - Object Basics - Use CPPLab
-   Fri 11:59PM - Object Basics - Creation CPPLab
-   Next Monday 11:59PM - Assignment 1

## Online Activity Outline

### Setup

Review the Syllabus in elearn and the [Class Policies](../policies).
Then do the Background survey and Class Policies Review activity in
eLearn.

If you did not take 161 at Chemeketa, you need
to become familiar with how I have things set up
and how to setup QtCreator.  Go to the [getting started with Qt Creator](https://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/courses/cs161/202030/week01/#getting-started-with-qt-creator)
information in CS161 week 1.  Follow the instructions to set up the
development environment, and watch the relevant videos.

If you took CS161 in Java (or did AP CS A), you need to learn the
basics of C++. The [Resource Links](../links) include some valuable C++
information you can refer to.

### OOP Basics

The history of modern programming is a quest for abstractions and
structure that can be added to assembly code to make programmers more
productive and less error prone. At some point, our code gets boiled down
to machine instructions we could have written directly in assembly…but
higher level languages allow us to more succinctly express ourselves
and provide structure and limitations that prevent us from writing
unintelligible and unmaintainable code.

**Object Oriented Programming** is a methodology for structuring programs
that aims to make parts of a system accessible to each other through high
level abstractions—so you don't have to know the ugly details of how a
window paints itself to the screen, just that you can ask it to repaint
itself by saying window.repaint(). It is the methodology of choice for
most large projects involving large teams of developers all working on
different parts of a system.  There is nothing we can write using OOP
we could not write without it, but it does make some jobs much easier.

Read Ch 9.1-9.5 and watch these videos:

Do the Objects Basics - Use CPPLab.

If you are not familiar with CPPLab, watch the video below. We will use
it to get some of the small scale practice required to really understand
what you are doing. Your username is the same as your my.chemeketa gmail
username. Your starting password is “changeme”; you can change it on
the login screen.

### Encapsulation, Headers and Information Hiding

Read Ch 9.6-9.7 and watch these videos:

{{< youtube videoid="5kk-fwedZDI" title="Header Files" >}}

Do the Objects Basics - Creation CPPLab.

### Documentation and UML

Read 9.10-9.11 and watch these videos:

{{< youtube videoid="P_XCKo0nP6o" title="WTH is UML?" >}}

Complete this week's assignment—start early so that you have time to
get assistance if you need it!

## Source Control

Source control is going to take you a while to master—don't worry
about doing it all this week. Watch the videos and at least work through
part 1 of this [Git Tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8dMsT6B2B7jW2Z0OWoV6TT8GOlYkDa9Bw0mhrUTuSU/edit?usp=sharing%22), which will walk you through making your
own close of the CS162 repository.

These videos introduce the basic idea behind source control, what git is, and how we will use it:

## Extra Info

### Git

[Visual Git Reference](https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)  
[Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)  
[Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

### OOP Introduction

New to object oriented programming? Having trouble seperating the
details from the big picture? Try reading [Don\'t fear the OOP](http://sepwww.stanford.edu/data/media/public/sep/jon/family/jos/oop/oop1.htm).

### Learncpp.com

The [Learn C++](http://learncpp.com/) online tutorial covers some of the same ground as the Liang readings. Use it as a supplement or second opinion if you ever need one on a topic. This week overlaps somewhat with their chapters 8.1–8.5 and 8.9.
