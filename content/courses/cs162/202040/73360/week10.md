## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this week, you should be able to:

* Use std::map to store data
* Use std::algorithms

## Suggested pacing

### Day 1

* Holiday

### Day 2

* Sets & Maps
* Read 22.6.1 - 22.6.2 on sets and maps
* Do Set/Map CPPLab

### Day 3

* Std::Algorithms
* Read 23.1-23.3. Use the rest of Ch 23 as reference - don't
    worry about reading/memorizing them all, just get used to the
    kinds of things you can do.
* Do Algorithms CPPLab

### Day 4

* Final review

## Final Notes

Here are the big ideas you should feel confident writing code on/answering
questions about:

* Objects & Composition
* Inheritance, Polymorphism & Virtual Functions
* Pointers & Shared memory
* Container classes - especially memory management
    (copy ctor, destructor and assignment operator)
* Templated functions/classes
* Recursion

## Online Activity Outline

### Sets & Map

Lists and vectors are both sequence containers - we think of the things in
them as being in a particular order. There is thing 0, thing 1, etc...
But sometimes, we want to refer to our data by its value. We want to say:
*Add "apple" to the collection* or *Do we have "apple" in the collection?*.

Associative containers organize their contents by its value, or key, and
thus make it easier to think about data in this way. Sets and maps (also
referred to as dictionaries) are the most common kinds of associative
containers.

Read 22.6.1-22.6.2 on sets and maps. Watch this video:

Do Maps/Sets CPPLab.

### STL Algorithms

The STL also provides algorithms for working with these various structures.
Do the Ch23 reading (23.1-23.2, skim the rest as you do CPPLabs).

Do Algorithms CPPLab.

### Quiz & Review

The final quiz includes material from weeks 8, 9, and 10.

You can take the final next Tues-Wed online in elearn. There is a review
guide in the Files area of week 10.
