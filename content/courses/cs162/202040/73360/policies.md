## Communication

Email is the best way to reach me for individual concerns. If you need to talk through
a concept or get my help debugging a program, please try come in for office hours.
Live conversation is much better for those activities than emails.

If there is any chance other students might benefit from hearing your question or the answer
or if they might be able to help with their own answers, use the discussion board in elearn.
I will respond to discussion threads with the same timeliness as email.
Keep in mind the guidelines for acceptable [collaboration](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/collaboration/)
with other students.

I generally will respond to any of these by the end of the next business day. 
During office hours I will respond live.

## The Work

Plan on spending 8-12 hours per week working on this course outside of
the classroom (12-16 total for online students). Predicting how long
it will take to write a computer program can be very difficult—do
not count on being able to block out a set number of hours each week to
complete your work. Start early in the week. If you start early and it
takes less time than you thought, you're done early, but if you start
later and it takes more time than you thought, you might not be able to
finish the way you want to.

### CPPLab

CPPLab is designed to provide a small incentive to work at a steady pace in the course. You will work
in CPPLab directly; there is nothing to submit to elearn. You can go back and work on the labs at any time, but you will only
get points for work you did on a problem set before its due date.

You may work with other students on CPPLab problems. It is fine to
[collaborate](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/collaboration/)
in real time with other people.

CPPLab computes grades on a curve, using the square root of the
percentage you earn on each assignment.  (For example, you solved 3
out of 4 problems. That would be 0.75, but the square root is .866 or
86.6%.) Your total score is the average of those curved scores. (For
example, you get 86.6% on one assignment and 100% on the next, so your
average is 93.3%.)

Notice that scoring 0/4 on one assignment and 4/4 on the next results in
a significantly lower score than scoring 2/4 on both assignments. That
is the purpose of the curve.  CPPLab is about trying little bits of code
while topics are fresh in your head. You will get more out of doing at
least some of each assignment than occasionally binging.

### Weekly Assignments

This is where you demonstrate an ability to solve problems with
algorithms and fluently write clean code. You can turn in updated
versions of any of the assignments any time before they are due. If I
see multiple versions of an assignment, **I will grade the one with the
latest date on it.** Late assignments are worth at *most* 70% of the
total, and only for a maximum 3 days after the original due date. Assignments
that fail to compile are worth at most 50%.

Assignments should be your own work. You should not share your code with
others, or make use of code provided by other students. Nor should you submit
code you find on the internet. For information about how to get or give help
without violating this policy, see the [collaboration guide](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/collaboration/).

Make sure to follow any instructions about file names—there are often
specific names you must give the files you submit for labs. Do not
submit extra files (e.g. project files your development environment
creates).

Assignments are generally graded and returned within one week of the due
date. I use rubrics to provide feedback—these are available for your
review in the eLearn class site as soon as your assignment is graded.

### Quizzes and Exams

Quizzes and exams will be administered through elearn. Each will be
available for a three-day window, during which you will be allowed one
attempt. There are no makeups or retakes, though I will replace
your lowest quiz with your score on the final if that helps your grade.
Quizzes and exams are to be done without any collaboration.

## Technology

Everyone taking this course needs regular access to a working computer
with internet access.

All of the software used in this course is freely available and can run
on Windows, Linux or Macs OS X. Although I am happy to help you
troubleshoot software issues in office hours, making sure you have a
working development environment is your responsibility.

Our course development environment is QtCreator with the Gnu g++ compiler.
You should [install it at home](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/qtcreator-setup/)
and become comfortable working with it.

If you choose to use another development environment (XCode, Visual
Studio, etc…), you must make sure you know how to use it to produce
platform neutral code—i.e. your code must compile on my machine in
the standard environment without any modifications.
