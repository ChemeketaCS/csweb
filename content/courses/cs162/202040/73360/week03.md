## Online Activity Outline

### Pointers Review

This material really goes with next week…you do not need it for this
week's assignment.

Learning to think in terms of pointers is one of the biggest
abstractions you will have to learn in CS. Go back to week 10 of
CS161 and watch the pointer basics video. Reread 11.1 and 11.2.

Read 11.3-11.4, 11.6. This material expands on the basics from 161.

Watch this video (related code is in the Github repository):

Do the Pointer Worksheet from the Files area in elearn - it is
similar to the one from CS161 but has more problems. Start by
reading the PointerWSExample file - it shows you how you should
record the effects of lines of code. Use the PointerWSKey to check
your work.

### Pointers and Objects

Read 11.10.

### Aggregation

Read [learncpp.com](http://www.learncpp.com/) Ch 10.3 for the ideas behind
aggregation—don't worry too much about the Teacher/Department sample
they use; though the idea makes sense, their example is too stripped
down to be informative. (Book Ch10.8 also talks about it, but in a very
limited way).

Watch this first video. It focuses on the basics for this week's
assignment.

Do the Aggregation CPPLab.

This second video looks at using aggregation to model relationships
between people and to navigate those relationships. It should give you
an idea about how to attack parts of this weeks assignment.

### Using `this`

Read 11.11.

Watch this video on a couple tips about using `this`:

### Quiz

Quiz 1 will be open in elearn Thursday through Saturday. The topics
include weeks 1 and 2 (Ch 9/10 + Unit Testing & Test Driven Development).
You are not responsible for 10.1/10.2 (string stuff) on the quiz.

When studying for the quiz, you might find it useful to use the sample
questions from the book author's website, linked from the resources
page here.
