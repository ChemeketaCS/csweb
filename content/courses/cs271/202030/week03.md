## Learning Objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Interpret binary data as a floating point number.
* Interpret binary data as a string of text.

## Deadlines this week

* Monday 11:59pm - Assignment 2

## Representing data

We'll be talking about a lot of different kinds of data, and how it can be
represented in binary, in class discussion. The main kinds of data it is
important for you to leave this class being familiar with are floating point
numbers and text.

The [CS160Reader] has a very good chapter with an overview of some
of this material. I also recommend reading the Wikipedia articles on
[floating point] and [Unicode].
