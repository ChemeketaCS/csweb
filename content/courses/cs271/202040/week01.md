This week will be all about introducing the course and how it will work,
and getting familiar with C programming. I will assume that you have
some experience with C++ programming, but C is its own language. If you
do have a lot of experience with C++, there will be a lot of changes
to get used to.  If you don't have very much C++ experience, we will be
taking C at a pace such that if you do a lot of extra practice in your
own you can still keep up. The material for this week, and the exercises,
will be drawn from [The C Book].
