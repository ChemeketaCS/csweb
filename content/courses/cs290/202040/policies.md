## The Work

### Weekly Assignments

These are practice designed to help you learn concepts/skills form the week. Although
they will based on the content we are covering, you will not necessarily be provided
samples of all the tools/syntax you need to use. You are expected to do research
as necessary to complete assignments.

I encourage students to study together and talk about the material in the course. Students
are however responsible for doing their own work. All work turned in as part of
an assignment should be your own. For more information on how to work with other students
without running afoul of class policies, please see the
[collaboration guide](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/collaboration/).

You get three "flex" days to use on weekly assignments. Each flex day buys up to 24 hours
of extra time on an assignment. You do not have to announce you are using flex days. If you turn
in an assignment late, I will simply deduct the appropriate number of flex days.

Examples:

* You turn in an assignment 8 hours late - I subtract one flex day.
* You turn in an assignment 12 minutes late - I subtract one flex day. (Don't try to
work right up to the wire and submit at 11:58pm).
* You turn in an assignment 46 hours late - I subtract two flex days.

Once you are out of flex days. These flex days are meant to cover ALL "life got in the
way" emergencies. Other than a major hospitalization or similar event, you will not
get other extensions. So make sure not to burn your flex days early in the term
just to do more work on something you started too late.

### Quizzes

These are short, low-stakes quizzes on the material from the week. They focus on
covering some of the details that you may not necessarily use as part of the weekly
assignments and making sure you know some of the "how and why" as well as how to write
code that works.

These are to be done independently. You should not communicate with anyone other than me
about the quiz until it is graded and released.

These may not be made up, although I will drop your lowest quiz.

### Group Project

You will complete a decent sized project as part of a small group that ties together
all the core skills from the course. There will be multiple mid-term deadlines to turn
in work on parts of the project before the final deadline. You also will be responsible
for demonstrating how your team collaborated and planned.

Although it is a group project, it is divided up so that there is a small core of shared
responsibility but most of your grade will come from your individual effort. Even if your
partner(s) flake, you should be able to earn a good grade on the project.

Baring major hospitalization or similar events, no late work will be accepted for any
of the deadlines on the group project. Make sure you submit well before the deadline.
You may NOT use flex days on the group assignment.

Members of a team are free to help each other with any part of the project, but are
expected to do their own development for their portion of the project. While it is
fine to help a group member fix bugs, it is not OK to write their code. It is also
not OK to slice up the project so that one person does all the HTML and another does
all the JS.
