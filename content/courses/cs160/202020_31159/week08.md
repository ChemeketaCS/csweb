## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Rank common classes of algorithm based on relative complexity
* Identify what class the basic search and sort algorithms fall into
* Write javascript functions that return values
* Identify pattern recognition algorithms and predict the behavior of simple decision trees and
neural networks

### First Meeting

**In class:**

* Algorithmic Efficiency intro
* code.org tips

**Independent:**

* Algorithmic Efficiency reading & worksheet
* Start the programming

### Second Meeting

**In class:**

* Pattern Recognition & machine learning exploration

**Independent:**

* Do Pattern Recognition practice

* Finish readings & do assignment

## Programming

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 2, Lesson 11, parts 1-21.
* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 2, Lesson 12, Parts 1-11.

## Algorithmic Efficiency

This week we are looking at how typically measure the efficiency of algorithms. The
algorithms we studied last week will be the main focus of our study.

* Read the [CS160 Reader - Algorithms chapter](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/Algorithms/index.html),
sections 8.9-8.13.
* Do the **Efficiency Worksheet**

## Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning

* Read Ch 6 of The Nine Algorithms book
* Read [CS160 Reader - Pattern Recognition supplement](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/PatternRecognition2.html)
* Do the **PatternRecognitionPractice** worksheet

## Optional Extras

Machine learning algorithms are one of the critical ingredients in the race to build self driving
cars. Car companies, tech companies and others are all trying to develop autonomous vehicles to
make roads more safe and efficient. Here are some videos about Google's efforts:

Machine learning has also been put to use to train computers to do more trivial things... like
play Super Mario:
