I will be available during the scheduled final time on slack to answer any last minute questions.
See the discussion board for details.


## Optional Normal Week 10 Topics

These are not on the final. But, they are interesting topics that cover the future of
computation and some of the limits of it.


### Future of Computing

* Read [chapter 11 of the CS160 Reader](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/LimitsAndFuture/index.html).
It discusses the algorithmic and engineering limitations computation faces, as well as one
possible future technology: quantum computing.
* **Optional**: A more detailed [description of how quantum computing works](https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/01/a-tale-of-two-qubits-how-quantum-computers-work/).

### Algorithm of the Week: Computability

* Read Ch 10 of Nine Algorithms book. It explores the idea of computability and how we know
some things are uncomputable (and have since before there were computers!).

* The [CS160 Reader - Nine Algorithms Supplement](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/Computability.html)
has a video that talks through the dilemma
posed in this chapter (and has a Dr. Suess style poem version of it.
