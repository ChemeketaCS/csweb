CS160 is designed to give a broad introduction to the field of computer science and introduction
to algorithmic thinking. It counts as a non-lab math/science course for the AAOT transfer degree.

It is NOT a course in using computers or computer applications; if that is what you are looking
for, please enroll in either CIS101 or CIS120. You MUST have completed a computer literacy
course (or have an equivalent background) and either completed or be co-enrolled in MTH111 to
take this course.

This is a transfer class - it must meet the requirements defined by the universities that most
Chemeketa students transfer to. The material moves at a quick pace and is challenging.
