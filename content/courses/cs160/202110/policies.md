## Communication

Email is the best way to reach me for individual concerns. I will
respond by the end of the next business day. During office hours I will
respond live.

If there is any chance other students might benefit from
hearing your question or the answer, or if they might be able
to help with their own answers, use the discussion board in
elearn. I will respond to discussion threads with the same
timeliness as email. Keep in mind the guidelines for acceptable
[collaboration](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/collaboration/)
with other students.

If you need to talk through a concept or get my help debugging a program,
please come to office hours. Live conversation is much better for those
activities than emails.

## The Work

Plan on spending 8-12 hours per week outside of class working on this
course (12-16 total if you are in an online section).  Many of the topics
we cover involve complex problem solving - there are times you are going
to get stuck and need to take a break to come back to a problem with
fresh eyes or to get help.  You are not likely to be successful if you
try to compress your work for each week into one day.

Each week features a collection of readings, videos, activities, etc. to
help you learn about the topics of the week. For each week there is
an assignment that you will turn in to demonstrate your mastery of
the material. There will be quizzes approximately every other week.
Even if you are an online student, CS160 is not a self paced course!

### Worksheets

You will often be provided with worksheets or other practice activities.
These are generally not collected, but they are an essential resource to
build skills and confirm understanding of materials. Keys are provided,
use them to verify you are on the right track before doing the graded
assignments.

### Programming Practice

Each week we do some programming activities that are graded on completion.
Your score for an assigned lesson of programming will be based on the
number of sections completed - 12 completed out of 15 assigned would be
80%. These practice assignments must be completed before you submit the
associated assignment to earn credit.

For in person classes, this score also includes participation in class
group learning activities.

### Assignments

Each week has an assignment. I provide a document with the questions
and a separate response document. You should write your answers in the
response document, save it as a PDF and upload that to elearn.

You can turn in updated versions of any of the assignment any time
before the due date.  If I see multiple submissions, I will grade the
most recent one (and ONLY that one - it must be a complete submission).
By default, do not expect to be able to turn in work late.  This is not
a self-paced course, and submitting work late makes it more difficult
for me to grade in a timely and consistent manner.  In practice, I am
usually happy to accept late work; please ask.

Assignments are generally graded and returned within a few days of the
due date. I use grading rubrics that will help you identify correct
answers and places where you went wrong. You can review the results in
elearn as soon as your assignment is graded.  There is often partial
credit available for questions so you should always make an attempt at
a response.

### Quizzes and Final Exams

The quizzes and exams for CS160 are "open book"; however, they are time
limited. If you know the material ahead of time then there should be
sufficient time to complete the quiz/exam. But if you resort to looking
things up during the quiz, you will almost certainly run out of time.

The quizzes/exams are not group projects. Collaborating on them is
not allowed.

Quizzes and the final will be taken by everyone during a set exam time
window (usually a 3-4 day period). There are no makeups of quizzes
or final.

Quizzes are generally graded and available for review within 3 days
of the end of the quiz period. I do not release the graded quiz until
the quiz period has ended as other students may not have completed the
quiz. Please do not ask questions about the quiz in the discussion board
until the entire quiz period has ended.

## Technical Support

Everyone taking this course needs regular access to a working computer
with internet access.

All of the software used in this course is freely available and can
run on Windows, Linux or Macs OS X. Although I am happy to help you
troubleshoot software issues in office hours, making sure you have a
working development environment is your responsibility.
