## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Perform simple math on unsigned binary numbers.
* Describe how binary values can be used to represent non-numeric data like text (ASCII) and images
* Perform conversion from hexadecimal (base 16) to and from binary.
* Calculate values using modulo (or clock) arithmetic
* Describe how two people can use the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to generate a shared secret without
exchanging secret messages.
* Write flexible functions using parameters
* Uses Loops to avoid code repetition

## Programming

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 3, Lesson 8, Parts 1-16 and 19 (skip 17 & 18).
* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 3, Lesson 9, Parts 1-14 and 17 (skip 15 & 16).

## Binary Math

Read [CS160 Reader sections 4.4 and 4.5](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/DataRepresentation/index.html).

## Other Types of Data

* Read about ACII representation of text and about how images can be represented: 
[CS160 Reader - Data Representation from 4.9 to 4.10](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/DataRepresentation/index.html)

* Read about Hexadecimal and hex color codes: [CS160 Reader - Data Representation from 4.11 to 4.12](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/DataRepresentation/index.html)

* Do the **ASCIIHex** worksheet. (Class Files link in elearn)

## Algorithm of the Week: Private Key Cryptography

* Read Ch 4 of Nine Algorithms the Changed the Future
  This video has some background and tips to go with the reading:

* Read CS160 Reader - [Diffie Hellman supplement](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/DiffieHellman.html).
It has tips on how to doing clock arithmetic.

## Optional Extras

The [Introduction to Cryptography on Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography)
is great if you want to learn more about cryptography and the related math.

Do you want to see the bits from a real image? Or any other file on your hard drive? Programs
called Hex Editors allow you to see the raw information in a file and modify it. You can google
"hex editor windows" or "hex editor mac" if you want to try one out.

If you are interested in how negative numbers and decimals are represented using bits in the
[CS160 Reader Ch4.6 & 4.7](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/DataRepresentation/index.html).
You can also try these videos for extra insight:
