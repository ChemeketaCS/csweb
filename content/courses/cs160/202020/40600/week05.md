## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Discuss and describe the major components of a CPU and their purpose, and the fundamental machine execution cycle (fetch-decode-execute)
* Trace the execution of and write simplified machine code programs
* Describe and perform common error detection and correction tricks used by computers
* Create a working multi-screen app
* Mentally evaluate javascript assignment statements involving arithmetic

## Suggested Pacing

Day 1
: Start the programming.

Day 2
: Work the Machine Architecture & The Little Computer sections.

Day 3
: Algorithm of the Week.

Day 4
: Finish the programming. Take the Quiz.

## Programming

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 1, Lesson 4, Parts 1-27.  
*Here is a [closed caption version of the video from 4-17](https://video.chemeketa.edu/media/CS+PrinciplesA+Intro+to+Variables+-+Part+2/1_thbj3njq)*

* For more practice mentally simulating variables, check out the Variable Practice worksheet in the Class Files.

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 1, Lesson 5, Parts 1-6, 8-20 (You can skip part 7).

    Hint: if you are stuck on figuring out the bug in part 6, you can skip ahead to part 8... it will explain the idea.

## Machine Architecture & the Machine Cycle

* Read about the major components of a CPU and the machine cycle: [CS160 Reader - Computer Architecture](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/ComputerArchitecture/index.html)
* **Optional** This video is a good secondary source. The first 12.5 minutes do a nice job of showing a processor
 at work. (From minute 12:30 until the end gets into more detail than we are going to worry about,
 but you may find it interesting.)

## Machine Code and the Little Computer

* Read about what machine language is: [CS160 Reader - Machine Language](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/ProgrammingLanguages/MachineLanguages.html)
*Just the one page this links to, not all of the Programming Languages chapter*

* Rather than try to work with real machine language, we are going to use something called the
Little Computer to see what a program is like at this level. [Read about the Little Computer
in the CS160Reader](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/ProgrammingLanguages/LittleComputer1.html).
(Just one page - there is more about the Little Computer that we will tackle next week.)

* Do the practice problems from **LMCWorksheet 1** (Class Files in elearn). You will need to make
use of this [Little Computer simulator](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/_static/littleComputer/littleComputer.html)

## Algorithm of the Week: Error Detection & Correction

* Read Ch 5 of Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future
* **Optional** The [CS160 Reader](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/ErrorCorrection.html)
has some extra material on how credit card numbers and book ISBN numbers use check sums.
