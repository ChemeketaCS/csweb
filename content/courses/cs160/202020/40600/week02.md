## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Describe the difference between analog and binary, bits and bytes
* Do conversions between binary and decimal number systems.
* Explain how the PageRank algorithm works
* Write functions to simplify code via abstraction and reuse
* Read function API documentation and make use of function libraries

## Suggested Pacing

Day 1
: Do the Bits and Binary materials.

Day 2
: Start the programming section. Try to get through 3-5 and 6. Check out and start the assignment.

Day 3
: Tackle the algorithm of the Week.

Day 4
: Finish the programming and assignment.

## Programming

{{% alert info %}}
I highly recommend that online students start the programming early in the week.
It is the activity you are most likely to get stuck on. If you don't understand
part of a reading, you are likely to be able to still get through the rest of it.
But when you have an issue figuring out how to do something in code, it may
prevent you from making any progress on later lessons.

You can work on it in parallel with the other material, but saving it for the last
minute is a recipe for trouble.

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 3, Lesson 5, Parts 1-12. Don't worry about
the last part of 3.5.6 titled Abstraction and AP Computer Science Principles.
* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 3, Lesson 6, Parts 1-3 & 6. In part 1 of
this lesson, there is a link to a PDF document that describes top down design. Do read the first page
of the document, but do not worry about doing the second page with a partner.
* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 3, Lesson 7, Parts 1-10 and 12-13 (skip 11).

## Bits

Read [CS160 Reader - Binary and Bits Chapter](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/Binary/index.html)

## Number Systems & Binary

Read [CS160 Reader - Data Representation](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/DataRepresentation/index.html) sections 4.1 to 4.3

Do the BinaryPractice worksheet. You can find it, and all future worksheets, in the Class Files link
in elearn. You can find a key for the worksheet there as well.

Worksheets like this are provided for your use to practice with material and verify that you
understand it before doing the weekly assignment. You will not turn them in. Use the key
to check your own work. If you have questions about any of the problems, ask about them on
the discussion board or in office hours.

## Algorithm of the Week: PageRank

* Read Chapter 3 of Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future
* Try out a [PageRank simulator](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/_static/pageRankApp/index.html)
(you will need to use this for your assignment).  
* You can find instructions in the [CS160 Reader - Page Rank Supplement](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/PageRank.html)
* You can find some sample problems and a key for them in the Class Files link in elearn. Use
them to explore some interesting aspects of how PageRank works.
