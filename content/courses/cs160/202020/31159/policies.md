CS160 is designed to give a broad introduction to the field of computer science and introduction
to algorithmic thinking. It counts as a non-lab math/science course for the AAOT transfer degree.

It is NOT a course in using computers or computer applications; if that is what you are looking
for, please enroll in either CIS101 or CIS120. You MUST have completed a computer literacy
course (or have an equivalent background) and either completed or be co-enrolled in MTH111 to
take this course.

This is a transfer class - it must meet the requirements defined by the universities that most
Chemeketa students transfer to. The material moves at a quick pace and is challenging. Plan on
spending 8-12 hours per week outside of class working on this course (12-16 total if you are in
an online section).

Many of the topics we cover involve complex problem solving - there are times you are going to
get stuck and need to take a break to come back to a problem with fresh eyes or to get help.
You are not likely to be successful if you try to compress your work for each week into one day.

## The Work

Each week features a collection of readings, videos, activities, etc... to help you learn about
the topics of the week. For each week there is an assignment that you will turn in to
demonstrate your mastery of the material. There will be quizzes approximately every other week.
Even if you are an online student, CS160 is not a self paced course!

### Worksheets

You will often be provided with worksheets or other practice activities.
These are generally not collected, but they are an essential resource to
build skills and confirm understanding of materials. Keys are provided,
use them to verify you are on the right track before doing the graded assignments.

### Programming Practice

Each week we do some programming activities that are graded on completion.
Your score for an assigned lesson of programming will be based on the number of sections
completed - 12 completed out of 15 assigned would be 80%. These practice assignments
must be completed before you submit the associated assignment to earn credit.

For in person classes, this score also includes participation in class group learning
activities.

### Assignments

Each week has an assignment. I provide a document with the questions and a separate
response document. You should write your answers in the response document,
save it as a PDF and upload that to elearn. (Word and google docs can both save
documents as a PDF.)

You can turn in updated versions of any of the assignment any time before the due date.
If I see multiple submissions, I will grade the most recent one (and ONLY that one -
it must be a complete submission). The scores for assignments turned in up to one week
late are capped at 70% of the possible points. Work turned in more than one week late
will receive no points.

Assignments are generally graded and returned within a few days of the due date. I
use grading rubrics that will help you identify correct answers and places where you
went wrong. your review in the eLearn class site as soon as your assignment is graded.
There is often partial credit available for questions so you should always make an
attempt at a response.

### Quizzes and Final Exams

The quizzes and exams for CS160 are "open book"; however, they are time limited. If
you know the material ahead of time then there should be sufficient time to complete the
quiz/exam. But if you resort to looking things up during the quiz, you will almost certainly
run out of time.

The quizzes/exams are not group projects. Collaborating on them is not allowed.

Quizzes and the final will be taken by everyone during a set exam time
window (usually a 3-4 day period). There are no makeups of quizzes or final.

Quizzes are generally graded and available for review within 3 days of the end
of the quiz period. I do not release the graded quiz until the quiz period has ended as other
students may not have completed the quiz. Please do not ask questions about the quiz in the
discussion board until the entire quiz period has ended.

## Student Collaboration

I encourage students to study together and talk about the material in the course. Students
are however responsible for doing their own work. Assignments and quizzes are **NOT GROUP PROJECTS**
and are to be done individually.

In general, I support collaboration that helps students develop their own understanding
of the material and independently demonstrate that understanding. Collaboration that deprives
students of a chance to develop a real understanding of the material, or that involves a
student submitting work that demonstrates someone else's understanding instead of their own,
is not permitted. Here are some examples of allowable forms of collaboration:

* Helping someone work through problems on a practice activity or showing them how you did a problem.
* Helping someone understand what an assignment question is asking about and pointing them.
* Posting your work for a practice problem and asking for help identifying where the error is.
* Asking about why your computer code might be producing a certain error message and posting a
single line that contains the error message. (Assuming the problem is more than a single line of code).
* Talking in general about the approach you used for a an assignment problem, or the ideas you
talked about in a question that involves a short answer.

And here are some examples that are not permissible:

* Showing your assignment to someone so they can see "how you did it".
* Asking another student to walk you through solving an assignment question.
* Posting your complete code for an assignment question and asking "why doesn't it work?".
* Posting your completed assignments on the web.
* Working with someone on a quiz.

### Discussion Board & Questions

The discussion board is a great place to ask general questions about course content.
It is not the appropriate place to post your answer to an assignment question and ask
*"Is this correct?"* If you want to ask about an assignment, you need to do so without asking
about a specific answer. That best way to do that is usually to ask a general question about the concept
involved or a specific question about a practice problem that is related to the
assignment question you are working on.

If you absolutely can't think of how to ask a general version of your question, please
ask it in office hours or via email.

## Technical Support

Everyone taking this course needs regular access to a working computer with internet access.
If you do not have access to such a computer at home you need to expect to spend a significant
amount of time in the open computer lab at Chemeketa.

All of the software used in this course is freely available and can run on Windows, Linux or Macs
OS X. Although I am happy to help you troubleshoot software issues in office hours, making sure you
have a working development environment is your responsibility.
