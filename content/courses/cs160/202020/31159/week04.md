## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Identify and evaluate the basic Boolean logic rules.
* Predict output of a simple logic circuit
* Make a program that responds to user actions
* Describe how asymmetric (public key) cryptography can be used to either authenticate a message or
send a private message
* Identify how certificate authorities provide a basis for trust on the internet

Note: The Finish button in theses lessons doesn't check your work like earlier lessons did.
It is up to you to make sure that the code you added is producing the desired results and
that you will be able to do the assignment problems correctly!

## Boolean Logic

* Read about boolean logic rules in the [CS160 Reader - Logic Gates 5.1-5.4](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/LogicCircuits/index.html).
* Do the short **Boolean Practice** worksheet (Class files link in elearn).

## Circuits

* Read [CS160 Reader - Logic Gates 5.5-5.8](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/LogicCircuits/index.html). Don't panic about memorizing the details in 5.7 and 5.8. They are examples of how circuits do "real" work in a computer that you should check out, but you are not responsible for knowing them.

* Do the **CircuitPractice** worksheet.
You can use this the [Circuit Playground from the CS160Reader](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/LogicCircuits/CircuitPlayground.html)
to build and test the circuits on the worksheet. This video shows how to do so:

* **Optional** This video does a good job of tying together bits, binary, logic and circuits.
If you are still feeling a little fuzzy on how bits and gates and circuits all tie together,
I highly recommend checking it out. Don't stress the details from minutes 7-10, just focus
on the big picture of how circuits manipulate on/off values to do math in a computer.

## Algorithm of the Week: Public Key Encryption

* Read the [CS160Reader's Chapter on Authentication & Public Key Encryption](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/Authentication/index.html).
* **Optional**: Read Ch 9 of Nine Algorithms book. The CS160Reader chapter is designed as a
replacement for the Nine Algorithms chapter. They cover similar ground - the ideal of
public/private key encryption, but CS160Reader version focuses more heavily on the use of this
technology in every day web security. The Nine Algorithms chapter does explore an additional
idea - that of using public/private key encryption to "sign" files that a user might download,
feel free to read it as a supplement or second perspective on this week's topic.

## Optional Extras

Have you heard of Bitcoin? It is a digital currency that uses public/private key technology to
sign transactions so that they can be verified by everyone using Bitcoins. This video explains
how it works:
