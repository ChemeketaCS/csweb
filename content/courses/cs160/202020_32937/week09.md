## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Discuss and describe the jobs of an operating system and the major resources it handles
* Explain the advantages and challenges of parallel processing
* Describe how databases are designed to maintain consistency in the face of failures and concurrent changes
* Write simple SQL queries
* Write while loops in javascript

## Suggested Pacing

Day 1
: Do the programming.

Day 2
: Tackle the Operating Systems and Parallel Processing material.

Day 3
: Do the Algorithm of the Week.

Day 4
: Do the SQL Section.

## Programming

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 2, Lesson 13, Parts 1-28.

## Operating Systems

* Read [CS160 Reader - Operating Systems](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/OperatingSystems/index.html)

* **Optional**:  This video complements the reading. The first part recaps the big pictures of what
an OS does. Second half talks about some important operating systems you might not have heard of.

## Parallel Processing

* Read [CS160 Reader - Parallel Processing](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/ParallelProcessing/index.html)

## Algorithm of the Week: Databases & Consistency

* Start with [CS160 Reader - Databases](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/DatabasesAndConcurrency.html).
It provides a quick introduction to help with theNine Algorithms reading.

* Read Ch 8 of Nine Algorithms book.

## Structured Query Language

Do the following SQL Tutorials. They introduce the real language used by many databases
to specify queries. At the bottom of each tutorial is a practice area where you can try
out queries. You can hit the "Read this task's Solution" link to see answers to these
exercises. Feel free to use this to see examples how different queries are written.

1) [Select queries](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_introduction)
2) [Queries with Constraints](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_constraints)
3) [Queries with Constraints Part 2](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_constraints_pt_2)
4) [Filtering and ordering](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/filtering_sorting_query_results).
Note - this tutorial does not spell out what ASC and DESC mean. ASC is short for
"ascending" - going up from smallest to largest. DESC is "descending" - listed from largest to smallest.
5) Skip #5
6) [Joins](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_joins)

* If you need more practice (had to ask to see solutions of lots of the practice problems),
check out the **SQLPractice** worksheet. (Class Files in elearn)

* **Optional**: Khan Academy has video tutorials on [SELECT](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/sql-basics/p/querying-the-table)
and [JOIN](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/relational-queries-in-sql/p/joining-related-tables)
that you might find helpful.

## Optional Extras

Video cards have hundreds or thousands of processing cores because they are optimized to
do different kinds of work than the CPU. This video explains:
