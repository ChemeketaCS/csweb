## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Describe, compare and contrast various professions and careers in Computing
* Chart an educational pathways for entrance into these professions
* Identify key developments in the evolution of computing hardware
* Explain how computers make use of indexes to search for information
* Construct a javascript program to draw patterns with basic commands

## Suggested Pacing

{{% alert info %}}
The suggested pacing is provided to help you set a schedule to complete the work gradually over the
course of the week.

Trying to pound through all the material in one or two giant sessions makes it much harder to
succeed in this course. It will make it harder to actually get the work done (especially in later
weeks where there is more work than week 1). It will also make it harder to get help in time
for you to make use of it.

Day 1
: Review class policies. Tackle the Computer Fields & Careers material.

Day 2
: Do the programming section. Check out and start the assignment (you won't be ready for all of it).

Day 3
: Algorithm of the Week.

Day 4
: History of Computing, attempt the rest of the assignment.

## Class Policies

Make sure that you have read and understood the Syllabus and Class Policies documents.
Both can be found in elearn. Make sure to take the background survey and Syllabus/Policy quiz in elearn.

## Why CS?

To find the right
Code.org course and to receive credit for doing the work, you will need to see the discussion board
for instructions about how to join my section in Code.org.

We will be working on the 2019-2020 version of the curriculum. Make sure you don't start the 2020-2021 version!
