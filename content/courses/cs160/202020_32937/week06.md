## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Describe the goals of higher level programming languages and how they relate to machine code
* Uses branches in the Little Computer to make decisions
* Use variables to build programs that track information
* Manipulate strings in javascript

## Suggested Pacing

Day 1
: Start the programming.

Day 2
: Little Computer Branching and Assembly sections.

Day 3
: And do the Algorithm of the Week.

Day 4
: Finish the programming. Read the High Level Programming section.

## Programming

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 1, Lesson 6, Parts 1-14.
* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 1, Lesson 8.

    Hint: if you are stuck on figuring out the bug in part 6, you can skip ahead to part 8... it will explain the idea.

## Little Computer Branching

Last week, we saw how a simple computer would process information and use its memory.
This week, we will look at how it could use branch instructions to allow us to say things
like "if the number is positive, do this, otherwise do that" and "go back to instruction 4"

* Read the [CS160 Reader - Little Computer 2](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/ProgrammingLanguages/LittleComputer2.html)
Ch 7.3 about how the branch instruction works.
* Do **LMCWorksheet 2** (Class Files link in elearn)
* You will need to make use of this [Little Computer simulator](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/_static/littleComputer/littleComputer.html)

## Assembly & The LMC

* Read about what an assembly language is: CS160 Reader - Assembly Language and how to write assembly for the Little Computer.
* Do **LMCWorksheet 3** (Class Files link in elearn)
* You will need to make use of this [Little Computer Assembler](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/_static/littleComputer/littleComputerAssembler.html)
and the [Little Computer simulator](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/_static/littleComputer/littleComputer.html)

## Higher Level Programming Languages

Read the rest of [CS160 Reader - Programming Languages chapter](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/ProgrammingLanguages/index.html).
It describes the higher level programming languages (like the JavaScript you are learning in the
Code.org lessons) that people generally program in.

## Algorithm of the Week: Data Compression

* Read Ch 7 of Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future
* Read the Data Compression supplement page in the [CS160 Reader](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/Compression.html).
It demonstrates how to build a Huffman code - a version of the Shortest Symbol trick from Nine Algorithms.
* Do the compression practice worksheet (Class Files in elearn)
