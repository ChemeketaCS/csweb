## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Describe what quantum computing is and why we are interested in it
* Argue why some problems cannot be solved by an algorithm
* Use while loops to write a simple simulation in javascript
* Use javascript arrays to store lists of information

## Suggested Pacing

Day 1
: Start the programming.

Day 2
: Tackle the Future Computing material.

Day 3
: Do the Algorithm of the Week.

Day 4
: Finish the programming. Take the quiz.

## Programming

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 2, Lesson 15, Parts 1-15.

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 2, Lesson 17, parts 1-14,
16-18 (skip 15).

## Future of Computing

* Read [chapter 11 of the CS160 Reader](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/LimitsAndFuture/index.html).
It discusses the algorithmic and engineering limitations computation faces, as well as one
possible future technology: quantum computing.
* **Optional**: A more detailed [description of how quantum computing works](https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/01/a-tale-of-two-qubits-how-quantum-computers-work/).

## Algorithm of the Week: Computability

* Read Ch 10 of Nine Algorithms book. It explores the idea of computability and how we know
some things are uncomputable (and have since before there were computers!).

* The [CS160 Reader - Nine Algorithms Supplement](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/Computability.html)
has a video that talks through the dilemma
posed in this chapter (and has a Dr. Suess style poem version of it.

## Finals Week Prep

The final is cumulative. If you want to get a head start on studying, the best thing
to do is go back and review the earlier quizzes and assignments.
