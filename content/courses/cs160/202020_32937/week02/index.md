* Assignment 1 is due by the end of the day (by 11:59PM) Monday. Submit your completed document to elearn.

{{< /style >}}

## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Describe the difference between analog and binary, bits and bytes
* Do conversions between binary and decimal number systems.
* Explain how the PageRank algorithm works
* Write functions to simplify code via abstraction and reuse

## Suggested Pacing

Monday
: Start the programming. Try to get through 3-5 and 6.

Tuesday
: Tackle the bits and binary sections.

Wednesday
: Finish the programming.

Thursday
: Algorithm of the Week.

## Programming

{{% alert info %}}

I highly recommend that online students start the programming early in the week. You can work
on it in parallel with the other material, but saving it for the last minute is a recipe for trouble.

* Complete Code.org Unit 3, Lesson 5, Parts 1-12. Don't worry about the last part of 3.5.6
titled Abstraction and AP Computer Science Principles.
[Closed Captioned Video from 3.5.2](https://smartplayer.captionsync.com/play.php?vid=1521238039sagefreeman_a8938290e7cc)
* Complete Code.org Unit 3, Lesson 6, Parts 1-3 & 6. In part 1 of this lesson, there is a
link to a PDF document that describes top down design. Do read the first page of the
document, but do not worry about doing the second page with a partner (especially if online).
* Complete Code.org Unit 3, Lesson 7, Parts 1-10 and 12-13 (skip 11).

## Bits

Read [CS160 Reader - Binary and Bits Chapter](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/Binary/index.html)

## Number Systems & Binary

Read [CS160 Reader - Data Representation](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/DataRepresentation/index.html) sections 4.1 to 4.3

Do the out the [BinaryPractice.docx](BinaryPractice.docx) and check with its [key](BinaryPracticeKey.docx).

## Algorithm of the Week: PageRank

* Read Chapter 3 of Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future
* Try out a [PageRank simulator](http://faculty.chemeketa.edu/ascholer/cs160/WebApps/PageRank/)
(you will need to use this for your assignment).  
* You can find instructions in the CS160 Reader - Page Rank Supplement
* You can find some sample problems and a key for them in the Files link below. (Look for files called[PageRankSimulations](PageRankSimulations.docx) and PageRankSimulationsKey)
