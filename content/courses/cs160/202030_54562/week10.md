## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Discuss and describe the jobs of an operating system and the major resources it handles
* Explain the advantages and challenges of parallel processing
* Describe how databases are designed to maintain consistency in the face of failures and concurrent changes
* Write simple SQL queries
* Write while loops in javascript

### First Meeting

**In class:**

* Parallel Processing
* code.org tips

**Independent:**

* Operating Systems & Parallel Processing reading
* Work on programming

### Second Meeting

**In class:**

* Databases intro

**Independent:**

* Do Databases reading
* Do SQL work

## Programming

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 2, Lesson 13, Parts 1-28.

## Operating Systems

* Read [CS160 Reader - Operating Systems](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/OperatingSystems/index.html)

* **Optional**:  This video reinforces the big ideas of the reading:

## Parallel Processing

* Read [CS160 Reader - Parallel Processing](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/ParallelProcessing/index.html)

## Algorithm of the Week: Databases & Consistency

* Start with [CS160 Reader - Databases](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/DatabasesAndConcurrency.html).
It provides a quick introduction to help with the Nine Algorithms reading.

* Read Ch 8 of Nine Algorithms book. You can skip the entire section titled **The
Prepare-Then-Commit Trick For Replicated Databases**. (Start reading again at
**Relational Databases And The Virtual Table Trick**).

## Structured Query Language

* Do the following SQL Tutorials. They introduce the real language used by many databases
    to specify queries. This video explains how to use them:

    * [Select queries](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_introduction)
    * [Queries with Constraints Part 1](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_constraints)
    * [Queries with Constraints Part 2](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_constraints_pt_2)
    * [Filtering and ordering](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/filtering_sorting_query_results)  
    *Tip: This tutorial does not spell out what ASC and DESC mean.
    ASC is short for "ascending"- going up from smallest to largest.
    DESC is "descending" - listed from largest to smallest.*

* If you feel like you need more practice, check out the **SQLPractice** worksheet.

## Optional Extras

Video cards (GPUs) are different than CPUs because they are optimized for parallel processing.
They are designed to process hundreds or thousands of similar jobs at the same time. Traditionally,
they were mostly used for graphics. But they are also good at the kinds of tasks that
machine learning requires. This video explains more:

## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Describe what quantum computing is and why we are interested in it
* Argue why some problems cannot be solved by an algorithm
* Use while loops to write a simple simulation in javascript
* Use javascript arrays to store lists of information

## Suggested Pacing

### Second Meeting

**In class:**

* Future computing
* Code.org programming intro

**Independent:**

* Start programming
* Future computing reading

### Second Meeting

**In class:**

* Computability

**Independent:**

* Nine Algorithms reading
* Finish programming
* Take Quiz

## Programming

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 2, Lesson 15, Parts 1-15.

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 2, Lesson 17, parts 1-14,
16-18 (skip 15).

## Future of Computing

* Read [chapter 11 of the CS160 Reader](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/LimitsAndFuture/index.html).
It discusses the algorithmic and engineering limitations computation faces, as well as one
possible future technology: quantum computing.
* **Optional**: A more detailed [description of how quantum computing works](https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/01/a-tale-of-two-qubits-how-quantum-computers-work/).

## Algorithm of the Week: Computability

* Read Ch 10 of Nine Algorithms book. It explores the idea of computability and how we know
some things are uncomputable (and have since before there were computers!).

* The [CS160 Reader - Nine Algorithms Supplement](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/Computability.html)
has a video that talks through the dilemma
posed in this chapter (and has a Dr. Suess style poem version of it.

## Finals Week Prep

The final is cumulative. If you want to get a head start on studying, the best thing
to do is go back and review the earlier quizzes and assignments.
