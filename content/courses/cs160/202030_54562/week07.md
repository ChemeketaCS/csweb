### First Meeting

**In class:**

* Sorting & Searching Algorithms
* Algorithm of the Week - AI Search

**Independent:**

* Do code.org programming
* Practice searching & sorting
* Take the Quiz

## Programming

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 1, Lesson 9, parts 1-15.
* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 5, Ch 1, Lesson 10, parts 1-23.

## Basic Searching And Sorting Algorithms

Searching and sorting are two fundamental tasks that any program dealing with lists
of data generally needs to do. We will be studying some algorithms for accomplishing
these tasks this week. Next week we will use these algorithms as the basis to learn about
how we compare the efficiencies of algorithms.

* Start by reading [CS160 Reader - Algorithms](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/Algorithms/index.html).
Read through section 8.8 (stop when you hit Efficiency - 8.9)
* Do the **SearchAndSort** worksheet. See the SortExamples document for examples of how to properly
do the sorts. (Class Files in elearn)
* **Optional**: These videos on how Selection and Insertion sort work might be handy:

* Read the pages on [Search and AI in the CS160 Reader](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/SearchAI/index.html).

* Do the **AISearchPractice** worksheet.

## Optional Extras
