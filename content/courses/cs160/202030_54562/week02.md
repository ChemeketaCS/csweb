## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Describe the difference between analog and binary, bits and bytes
* Do conversions between binary and decimal number systems.
* Explain how the PageRank algorithm works
* Write functions to simplify code via abstraction and reuse
* Read function API documentation and make use of function libraries

### First Meeting

**In class:**

* Binary and Bits Overview
* JS Functions Tips

**Independent:**

* Do the Bits & Binary readings and worksheet
* Work on programming lessons 5 & 6

### Second Meeting

**In class:**

* PageRank Activity
* JS Advice

**Independent:**

* Do the Algorithm of the Week reading
* Finish programming

## Programming

* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 3, Lesson 5, Parts 1-12. Don't worry about
the last part of 3.5.6 titled Abstraction and AP Computer Science Principles.
* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 3, Lesson 6, Parts 1-3 & 6. In part 1 of
this lesson, there is a link to a PDF document that describes top down design. Do read the first page
of the document, but do not worry about doing the second page with a partner.
* Complete [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/home) Unit 3, Lesson 7, Parts 1-10 and 12-13 (skip 11).

## Bits

Read [CS160 Reader - Binary and Bits Chapter](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/Binary/index.html)

## Number Systems & Binary

Read [CS160 Reader - Data Representation](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/DataRepresentation/index.html) sections 4.1 to 4.3

Do the BinaryPractice worksheet. You can find it, and all future worksheets, in the Class Files link
in elearn. You can find a key for the worksheet there as well.

Worksheets like this are provided for your use to practice with material and verify that you
understand it before doing the weekly assignment. You will not turn them in. Use the key
to check your own work. If you have questions about any of the problems, ask about them on
the discussion board or in office hours.

## Algorithm of the Week: PageRank

* Read Chapter 3 of Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future
* Try out a [PageRank simulator](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/_static/pageRankApp/index.html)
(you will need to use this for your assignment).  
* You can find instructions in the [CS160 Reader - Page Rank Supplement](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/NineAlgorithms/PageRank.html)
* You can find a worksheet called PageRankPractice and a key for it in the Class Files link
in elearn. Use them to explore some interesting aspects of how PageRank works.
