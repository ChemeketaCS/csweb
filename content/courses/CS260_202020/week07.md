## Due this week

{{% alert warning %}}

* Assignment 3. Submit writeup and push final code by deadline.
* Saturday 11:59PM - BST Balancing CPPLab

{{% /alert %}}

## Learning objectives

* Perform rotations in a tree and correctly splay a node to root using rotations
* Perform basic operations in an AVL tree
* Identify how adding items to a B-Tree will affect its structure

## Assignment 4

You are 100% ready to do on assignment 4. Use this week to get a good start on it.

## Day 1

Rotations & Splay Trees

* Read Ch25.1 - 25.2

* Watch this video on rotations and splaying:

* Experiment with Gnarly Trees. Chose DataStructures->Dictionaries->Rotations and DataStructures->Dictionaries->SplayTree.
The Rotations simulator uses "child" notation to specify a rotation.

* Do the BST Rotation WS

## Day 2

### Balancing Basics 

* Watch this video about basic balancing techniques in BSTs:
{{< youtube videoid="GwMIrwjGfps" >}}

* Do the BST Balancing CPPLab

### AVL Trees

* Read ch 25.1, 25.2, 25.8. Don't stress about about the detailed code, focus on what an AVL tree
does to maintain balance. Then watch this video:

* Experiment with Gnarly Trees. Chose DataStructures->Dictionaries->AVL.

* Do AVL WS

## Day 3

Holiday

## Day 4

B-Trees

* Watch this video on B-Trees:
{{< youtube videoid="kosSCEMVSIM" >}}

* Experiment with Gnarly Trees. Chose DataStructures->Dictionaries->B-Tree.
