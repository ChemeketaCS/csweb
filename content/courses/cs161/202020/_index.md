These pages contain curriculum resources for CS161.

The CS161-CS162-CS260 sequence serves as an introduction to computer science, software
engineering and programming. It is intended for future Computer Science, Computer Engineering
and Electrical Engineering students. Although it counts as an AAOT Math/Science credit, it is
NOT a recommended class for non-majors looking for science credits - they should take CS160.

This is a transfer class; thus it must meet the requirements defined by the universities that
most students transfer into (OSU, Western, PSU, OIT and UofO). The material moves at a quick
pace starting from week 1, be ready to work hard early on in this course; if you get behind,
it will be very difficult to catch up.
