## Learning Objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Read code that uses pointers and references
* Create dynamically allocated storage

## Deadlines This Week

* NEXT WEEK - Final
* Saturday 11:59PM (Opens Thursday)- Quiz 4 - covers weeks 8-10.  
  * This includes the material on pointers from this
    week (Ch 11) - you need to get through that material before you take
    the quiz.
* Friday 11:59PM - Photochop mini-assignment - turn in your functions
  in elearn.
  * Build at least two new image creation/modification functions for
    PhotoChop. You must build make functions from two different
    categories (Create Image/Basic Filter/Complex Filter/Size
    Modifying/Multiple Image).
* Sunday 11:59PM - Assignment 9. No late work will be accepted for
  assignment 9.

## Schedule

* Come in for quiz/final practice or assignment questions

## Activity Outline

### Pointers
  
{{% alert info %}}
This week you do not have to write code using
pointers (unless you do the challenge for assignment 9). Our goal with
the material in Ch11 is just to gain an understanding of what pointers
are and how they work. They are a tricky concept that we will learn more
about in 162 and rely on heavily for 260... this is the gentle preview
of the topic. So by all means, try things out in QtCreator, but keep in
mind that our goal for now is just to understand them, not proficiently
use them.

Read chapter 11.1-11.3 about the basics of pointers. This video
helps explain what they are:

Do the Pointer worksheet from the Classroom files link. There is an
example problem and key is available in that folder as well.

This [C++ Code Visualizer](http://pythontutor.com/cpp.html#mode=edit) can be a
handy tool for visualizing what is happening in memory. It shows
pointers as arrows to the location they point. That is a good high
level mental model, but you should also understand that the pointer
is storing something - a memory address.

Watch this video about dynamic memory:

Read 11.9

## Extra Info

### C++ Notes

These items linked to on this page have nice conscise pointer information  
[C++ Notes](http://www.fredosaurus.com/notes-cpp/) focus on ones called:

* Addresses, pointers, references
* Pointers
* The NULL pointer
* Dynamic Allocation of Arrays

### Learncpp.com

This online tutorial covers *some* of the same ground as the Liang readings:  
[LearnCpp.com 6.7-6.9](http://www.learncpp.com/) for Pointers and dynamic allocation  

### Notes

1. Congratsâ€”you are almost there\!
2. Start studying for the final now. Go back to earlier chapters
   (especially ones you had problems with), do questions from the end
   of each chapter and check yourself.
