## Activity Outline

### Quiz

Quiz 4 will be open from Thursday to Saturday, as usual for the previous
quizzes. Also as usual, it will cover material from the previous
two weeks.  Unusually, it will include the material on pointers from
this week (from Chapter 11).

Make sure you get through that material on pointers in Chapter 11
before taking the quiz this week.

### Pointers
  
{{% alert info %}}
This week you do not have to write code using
pointers (unless you do the challenge for assignment 9). Our goal with
the material in Ch11 is just to gain an understanding of what pointers
are and how they work. They are a tricky concept that we will learn more
about in 162 and rely on heavily for 260... this is the gentle preview
of the topic. So by all means, try things out in QtCreator, but keep in
mind that our goal for now is just to understand them, not proficiently
use them.

Read chapter 11.1-11.3 about the basics of pointers. This video
helps explain what they are:

Do the Pointer worksheet from the Classroom files link. There is an
example problem and key is available in that folder as well.

This [C++ Code Visualizer](http://pythontutor.com/cpp.html#mode=edit) can be a
handy tool for visualizing what is happening in memory. It shows
pointers as arrows to the location they point. That is a good high
level mental model, but you should also understand that the pointer
is storing something - a memory address.

Watch this video about dynamic memory:

Read 11.9

### Final prep

The final exam will be taken in a similar manner to the midterm.
This term's final will be different than previous term's finals, so
the class files final prep material does not correspond perfectly to
the material that you will encounter. In particular, there will not
be a question about image manipulation related to PhotoChop.  However,
that practice final might still be a good way to study the other material.

## Extra Info

### C++ Notes

These items linked to on this page have nice conscise pointer information  
[C++ Notes](http://www.fredosaurus.com/notes-cpp/) focus on ones called:

* Addresses, pointers, references
* Pointers
* The NULL pointer
* Dynamic Allocation of Arrays

### Learncpp.com

This online tutorial covers *some* of the same ground as the Liang readings:  
[LearnCpp.com 6.7-6.9](http://www.learncpp.com/) for Pointers and dynamic allocation  

### Lastly

Congratulationsâ€”you are almost there\!
