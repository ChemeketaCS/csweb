## Learning Objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Describe how a C++ program goes from source code to working program
* Identify the functions of basic components of a C++ program
* Do basic console input/output
* Use assignment and the basic math operators

## Deadlines This Week

* Wednesday 11:59pm - Background Survey and Class Policies Review in eLearn. The review is scored as an assignment. The survey is not graded, but if you do not complete it you will be given a 0 on the Class Policies Review.

## Schedule

### Monday

* Setup access to Revel Introduction to Programming with C++ - see discussion board for link
* Review Syllabus and Course Tips
* Read Ch 1.1-1.6
* Install QtCreator at home

### Tuesday

* Declare variable, assign values, do math. Use the debugger.
* Finish Ch1, Ch 2.4-2.6
* Do MentalCodeDebugging WS

### Wednesday

* Write a program that accepts input, calculates an answer and outputs it.
* Ch 2.1-2.3 and 2.8-2.10

### Thursday

* Wrap up samples.
* Development advice.
* Read Ch 2.14

## Course Intro

Review Syllabus and Course Tips.
Then do the Background survey and Class Policies Review activity in eLearn.

Do the Ch 1 reading. Ch 1.1-1.6 will be mostly review if you took CS160. If not, don't panic about memorizing every detail.

## Getting Started With QT Creator

Start by [installing and setting up Qt Creator][qtinstall].
The video below demonstrates how and explains what you are doing;
you will need the [QtProject][qtproject] files mentioned in the video.

[qtinstall]:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AMvLP1THLpWVqYWTAQeBTeCoX0kXKRp6-aXfeSkNVag/edit#heading=h.rihp46pqexgr

{{% alert info %}}
The videos here often show out-of-date versions of e.g. the course web site.
If you can't find something you need here, or anything doesn't work as the video says it
does and you can't easily see how to fix it, please raise the issue in the discussion forum.

For any video, you can click in the lower right corner to watch on YouTube. You can then use
the settings icon there (Gear symbol at bottom of video) to watch at higher quality. Doing
so can make a big difference when trying to read code examples.

All code you submit must build using standard C++. Using QTCreator will help make sure you
write code that will be acceptable. It will also make it easier to test out my code samples.

If you try to use another tool for programming (XCode on Mac, Visual Studio on Windows) and
don't know what you are doing, you are going to have a harder time and be more likely to
turn in code that does not work correctly. Start out with QTCreator and experiment with
other tools as you get more experience.

This video introduces how to work with projects and rename code files safely:

This video explains how to make use of course code samples:

## C++ & Development Basics

Work your way through the first parts of Ch 2. This video gives some advice about using cin to take
input from the user:

Do the MentalCode worksheet to practice using the debugger and test your understanding of how math
works in C++(See Elearn for the Class Files link to access this and future practice
activities and other resources) . The debugger is a CRITICAL tool
for learning programming. It is what lets you look at what your code is doing step by step. These
two videos introduce it and talk about some of the odder things you will see math wise while
programming:

Start the assignment as you finish Ch 2. This video talks through that program to show how you
should approach building programs. One step at a time:

## Extra Info

### Learncpp.com

The [Learn C++](http://learncpp.com/) online tutorial covers some of the same ground as the Liang readings. Use it as a supplement or second opinion if you ever need one on a topic. This week overlaps somewhat with their chapters 0, 1.1–1.3, 2.1–2.5, and 3.1–3.2.

{{% alert warning %}}
Learncpp.com shows how to use multiple different IDE's for writing code. Until you know how to test to see if your code is standards compliant, I highly recommend sticking with QtCreator and the provided templates.
