## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Describe how a C++ program is goes from source code to working program
* Identify the functions of basic components of a C++ program
* Do basic console input/output
* Use assignment and the basic math operators

## In Person Schedule

### Monday

* Setup access to Revel Introduction to Programming with C++ - see discussion board for link
* Review Syllabus and Course Tips (find them in the Documents link at the top of the page)
* Read Ch 1.1-1.6
* Install QtCreator at home

### Tuesday

* Declare variable, assign values, do math. Use the debugger.
* Finish Ch1, Ch 2.4-2.6
* Do MentalCodeDebugging WS

### Wednesday

* Write a program that accepts input, calculates an answer and outputs it.
* Ch 2.1-2.3 and 2.8-2.10

### Friday

* Wrap up samples.
* Development advice.
* Read Ch 2.14

I highly recommend online students set a schedule similar to what we do in class. This
section contains more detailed instructions for online students.

## Course Intro

Watch this quick website intro video:

{{% alert info %}}
For any video, you can click in the lower right corner to watch on YouTube. You can then use
the settings icon there (Gear symbol at bottom of video) to watch at higher quality. Doing
so can make a big difference when trying to read code examples.

Review Syllabus and Course Tips (find them in the Documents link at the top of the page).
Then do the Background survey and Class Policies Review activity in eLearn.

Do the Ch 1 reading. Ch 1.1-1.6 will be mostly review if you took CS160. If not, don't
panic about memorizing every detail.

## Getting Started With QT Creator

On the Resources Links page, find the Qt Creator Setup Instructions.

Begin by following these instruction to setup QTCreator and make your first project. The video below
demonstrates how and explains what you are doing:

All code you submit must build using standard C++. Using QTCreator will help make sure you
write code that will be acceptable. It will also make it easier to test out my code samples.

If you try to use another tool for programming (XCode on Mac, Visual Studio on Windows) and
don't know what you are doing, you are going to have a harder time and be more likely to
turn in code that does not work correctly. Start out with QTCreator and experiment with
other tools as you get more experience.

This video introduces how to work with projects and rename code files safely:

This video explains how to make use of course code samples:

## C++ & Development Basics

Work your way through the first parts of Ch 2. This video gives some advice about using cin to take
input from the user:

Do the MentalCode worksheet to practice using the debugger and test your understanding of how math
works in C++(See Elearn for the Class Files link to access this and future practice
activities and other resources) . The debugger is a CRITICAL tool
for learning programming. It is what lets you look at what your code is doing step by step. These
two videos introduce it and talk about some of the odder things you will see math wise while
programming:

Start the assignment as you finish Ch 2. This video talks through that program to show how you
should approach building programs. One step at a time:

## Extra Info

### Compiling details

Looking for more information on what exactly happens when code is compiled? Try here:

### Learncpp.com
This [leancpp.com](learncpp.com) online tutorial covers some of the same ground as the Liang
readings. Use it as a supplement or second opintion if you ever need one on a topic.
