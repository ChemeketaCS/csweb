## Activity Outline


### Array Basics

Read Ch 7.1-7.2. These videos covers some of the important (and
sometimes unmentioned) details

Do the CPPLab Array Basics


### Arrays Continued

Watch the video below and then read Ch 7.4 for various examples of
using arrays.

Read 7.5-7.8. This video shows some important details of how arrays
work with functions and how to use QtCreator to debug arrays in
functions:

Do the CPPLab Arrays 2

### Multi-dimensional Arrays

Read Ch 8.1-8.4  
This video has some background on why 2D arrays behave the way they
do and how to use the debugger on them in QtCreator:

Do the CPPLab Multidimensional Arrays CPPLab–due Friday

Read Ch 8.5-8.8.1
This video talks through some of the interesting things in the
sample programs from those sections, as well as some things that
could be improved in them.

Start the assignment.


## Extra Info

### Optional extra

Watch this video about how matrices are used to handle transformations in computer graphics.  
There is a project folder MatrixGraphics and a pdf with instructions
in the Classroom slides/examples. Grab the project and
instructions and experiment with setting up a 2D array to work as a transformation matrix.
