* Pointer Worksheet

### Day 2

* Dynamic Memory
* Read chapter 11.9

### Day 3
    
* Final review

### Day 4

* Quiz 4

## Activity Outline
### Pointers
  
{{% alert info %}}
This week you do not have to write code using
pointers (unless you do the challenge for assignment 9). Our goal with
the material in Ch11 is just to gain an understanding of what pointers
are and how they work. They are a tricky concept that we will learn more
about in 162 and rely on heavily for 260... this is the gentle preview
of the topic. So by all means, try things out in QtCreator, but keep in
mind that our goal for now is just to understand them, not proficiently
use them.

Read chapter 11.1-11.3 about the basics of pointers. This video
helps explain what they are:

Do the Pointer worksheet from the Classroom files link. There is an
example problem and key is available in that folder as well.

This [C++ Code Visualizer](http://pythontutor.com/cpp.html#mode=edit) can be a
handy tool for visualizing what is happening in memory. It shows
pointers as arrows to the location they point. That is a good high
level mental model, but you should also understand that the pointer
is storing something - a memory address.

Watch this video about dynamic memory:

Read 11.9

### Final prep

The final exam will be a similar format to the midterm. There is a practice
final available in elearn.

## Extra Info

### C++ Notes

These items linked to on this page have nice concise pointer information  
[C++ Notes](http://www.fredosaurus.com/notes-cpp/) focus on ones called:

* Addresses, pointers, references
* Pointers
* The NULL pointer
* Dynamic Allocation of Arrays
