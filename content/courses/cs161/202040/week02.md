## Learning Objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Use relational operators to construct simple boolean statements
* Write a program using conditional expressions

## Schedule Checklist

### Day 1

* Type Conversions, other Operators
* Read 2.7, 2.11-13, and 2.16
* Do MentalCodeOpsCasts WS

### Day 2

* Booleans and If
* Read Ch 3.1-3.4
* CppLab conditionals 1

### Day 3

* Nested Ifs
* Conditional Operators
* Read Ch 3.5-3.8
* CppLab conditionals 2

### Day 4

* Boolean Operations/Switch
* Do BooleanPractice WS
* Read Ch 3.10-3.11, 3.13-3.16

## Data Conversions and Other Operators

* Read the last parts of chapter 2. Do the MentalCodeOpsCasts worksheet (see
  Classroom files link). Like last week, try doing in your head, then
  check it using the debugger.

## Conditionals

* Read Ch 3.1-3.4. This video introduces some of the key concepts:

* Do Conditionals 1 CPPLab. There is a link to CPPLab at the top of
  this page. Your username is the same as your Chemeketa username.
  Initial password is "**changeme**" without quotes. You can change it on
  the login screen.  
  
  CPPLab is designed to give you the practice you
  need to really learn how to program. Some of the problems are easy,
  some are hard. Each assignment is scored on a generous curve - you
  should make sure to do some work on each one but not panic if every
  now and then you get stuck.

* Read powerpoint on Scope from the Classroom/sides examples. It
  covers some useful background material that the book does not
  mention until later. This video walks through some demonstrations of
  how scope affects variables:

* Read Ch 3.5-3.8. This video introduces some of the ideas:

* Do Conditionals 2 CPPLab.  

* This video demonstrates using the debugger to trace your way through
  the computer tax example:

* Read Ch 3.10-11 and 3.13-16.  
  <span class="red">Note: you do not need these parts of Chapter 3 to
  do the assignment or CPPLabs. Next week involves less material, if
  necessary you can worry about mastering these section next
  week.</span>  
  These videos cover the basics of those sections:

  {{< youtube videoid="VqPGhExBv8c" title="Boolean Details" >}}
    
* Do the Boolean Practice worksheet (see Classroom slides/examples
  link below for WS and key).

* Do the assignment.
