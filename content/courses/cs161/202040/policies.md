## Communication

Email is the best way to reach me for individual concerns. I will respond by the end of the next business day. During office hours I will respond live.

If there is any chance other students might benefit from hearing your question or the answer, or if they might be able to help with their own answers, use the discussion board in elearn. I will respond to discussion threads with the same timeliness as email. Keep in mind the guidelines for acceptable [collaboration](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/collaboration/) with other students.

If you need to talk through a concept or get my help debugging a program, please come to office hours. Live conversation is much better for those activities than emails.

## The Work

Plan on spending 8-12 hours per week working on this course outside of
the classroom (12-16 total for online students). Predicting how long
it will take to write a computer program can be very difficult—do
not count on being able to block out a set number of hours each week to
complete your work. Start early in the week. If you start early and it
takes less time than you thought, you're done early, but if you start
later and it takes more time than you thought, you might not be able to
finish the way you want to.

### CPPLab

CPPLab is designed to provide a small incentive to work at a steady pace in the course. You will work
in CPPLab directly; there is nothing to submit to elearn. You can go back and work on the labs at any time, but you will only
get points for work you did on a problem set before its due date.

You may work with other students on CPPLab problems. It is fine to
[collaborate](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/collaboration/)
in real time with other people.

CPPLab computes grades on a curve, using the square root of the
percentage you earn on each assignment.  (For example, you solved 3
out of 4 problems. That would be 0.75, but the square root is .866 or
86.6%.) Your total score is the average of those curved scores. (For
example, you get 86.6% on one assignment and 100% on the next, so your
average is 93.3%.)

Notice that scoring 0/4 on one assignment and 4/4 on the next results in
a significantly lower score than scoring 2/4 on both assignments. That
is the purpose of the curve.  CPPLab is about trying little bits of code
while topics are fresh in your head. You will get more out of doing at
least some of each assignment than occasionally binging.

### Weekly Assignments

The weekly programming assignments are about demonstrating an ability
to solve problems with algorithms and fluently write clean code. You
will submit your code in elearn.

Make sure to follow any instructions about file names—there are often
specific names you must give the files you submit for labs. Do not submit
extra files (for example, do not submit project files your development
environment creates). You can turn in updated versions of any of the
assignments any time before they are due. If I see multiple versions of
an assignment, I will grade the one with the latest date on it.

Assignments are to be done individually.  I use an automatic tool to scan
assignments for code that is duplicated in different submissions. If I
have doubts about whether you wrote your own program, I may require you
to come to office hours for a code review where I ask you to explain the
code, its development, and how you might modify it. I may give zero points
for a submission I believe to be plagiarized. Refer to the [collaboration
guide](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/collaboration/)
for more details.

By default, do not expect to be able to turn in work late.  This is not
a self-paced course, and submitting work late makes it more difficult
for me to grade in a timely and consistent manner.  In practice, I am
usually happy to accept late work; please ask.

It is your responsibility to ensure that your code will compile and run.
I do not promise to adapt your code to make it testable, so even very
complete code might be ungradeable if it has a flaw that makes it
fail to compile. Again, in practice I try to help, but in the end the
responsibility is yours.

I will generally grade and return feedback on assignments within one
week of the due date. I use rubrics to provide feedback—these are
available for your review in elearn as soon as your assignment is graded.

### Quizzes and Exams

Quizzes and exams will be administered through elearn. Each will be
available for a two-day window, during which you will be allowed one
attempt. Your attempt lasts 60 minutes for each quiz and 90 minutes
for each exam.  There are no makeups or retakes, though I will replace
your lowest quiz with your score on the final if that helps your grade.
Quizzes and exams are to be done without any collaboration.

## Technology

Everyone taking this course needs regular access to a working computer
with internet access.

All of the software used in this course is freely available and can run
on Windows, Linux or Macs OS X. Although I am happy to help you
troubleshoot software issues in office hours, making sure you have a
working development environment is your responsibility.

Our course development environment is QtCreator with the Gnu g++ compiler.
You should [install it at home](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/qtcreator-setup/)
and become comfortable working with it.

If you choose to use another development environment (XCode, Visual
Studio, etc…), you must make sure you know how to use it to produce
platform neutral code—i.e. your code must compile on my machine in
the standard environment without any modifications.
