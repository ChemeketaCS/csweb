## Class Resources

[CPPLab](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cpplab/)

[Book Website](https://console.pearson.com/console/home)  
[Book author's website](http://liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/liang/cpp3e/)  
[Source code for book examples](http://liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/liang/cpp3e/examplesource.html)  
This corresponds to the third edition of the book, so there will be some slight differences. However, it is still a useful resource for sample code and practicing for quizzes.

[Qt Creator Setup Instructions](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/qtcreator-setup/)

The [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/cpp) website can be used as a short-term alternative to
QTCreator for writing code if you have setup issues. However, it might not work for every assignment going forward, so don't rely on it.
