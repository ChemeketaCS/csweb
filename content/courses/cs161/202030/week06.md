Read 6.12-6.13 and watch these videos on reference parameters.  

{{< youtube videoid="asYBtFbYF-U" title="Reference Parameters" >}}
{{< youtube videoid="InM774qSb1M" title="Visualizing Reference Parameters" >}}

Do the CPPLab Functions 2

Read 6.8 and skim [LearnCpp.com Chapter 2.10-2.11](http://www.learncpp.com/) which covers header
files (not covered well in the book). Then watch this video that
talks about some other techniques for building and documenting
complex programs and libraries of functions:

Finally, read 6.15 and watch this video on how to go about designing
and building programs using functions:
