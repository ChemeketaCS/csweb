### Day 3

* No class - Work on C -Headers and IO Material

### Day 4

* Arrays
* Read Ch 7.1-7.2, 7.4

## Activity Outline

### Array Basics

Read Ch 7.1-7.2. These videos covers some of the important (and
sometimes unmentioned) details

### C based IO

Although C++ shares much with C (most, but not all, C code is valid C++
code), there are significant differences. One of the key differences in
terms of the material we have learned about is how IO is done - there
are no cin and cout. The C tools for doing IO, especially output,
provide some advantages - you will see C++ code that uses the C tools
instead of cout for this reason. You also are likely to be required to
program in C some future course... it is worth becoming familiar with
the basic differences now.

Start by watching this video about C based input/output functions:

To make a C project in QtCreator, chose the Template **Non-Qt
Project â†’ Plain C Project**

It will have the proper header for doing IO in C: **\<stdio.h\>**.
If you want to use printf and scanf in a C++ program you would
include that header as **\<cstdio\>**

[This document](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/cpp/c1_Basics.html)
has concise examples of using printf and scanf (scroll way down to
sections 3.8 and 3.9. [cplusplus.com has a less friendly but more complete listing](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/)
of printf options.
