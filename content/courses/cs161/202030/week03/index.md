## Quiz

The quiz will be open Thursday–Saturday in Elearn, **time limited**
(60 minutes), and **not** collaborative. It covers weeks 1 & 2. Make sure
you block out an hour of uninterrupted time before you start the quiz — you
can not pause the timer once you start.

To practice, go to the [Resource Links]({{< ref "links/#class-resources" >}} "Resource Links")
and look for "Book author's website". On the author's website, look for the Quiz tab:

The practice questions are based on the third edition of the book, so later chapters
may be numbered slightly differently, but the questions are still great practice.

For quiz 1, focus on Ch1, 2, and 3 (especially 2 and 3) to get ready for the quiz. The
quiz will be some multiple choice, some short answer, and some writing code. Make sure
to read the directions carefully before beginning.
