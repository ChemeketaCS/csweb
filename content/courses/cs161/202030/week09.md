## Learning objectives

Upon finishing this learning module, you should be able to:

* Use enums and typedefs to improve code readability and safety
* Use structs to represent heterogeneous collections of data


## Readings & Activities

### Day 1
    
* Enums, Typedef & Namespaces
* See Activity outline section below for readings

### Day 2
    
* Bitflags
* Structs
* See Activity outline section below for readings

### Day 3
    
* Structs and arrays

### Day 4

* Assignment Intro & Photochop

## Online Activity Outline

## Quiz

Open Thursday-Sat in Elearn, *time limited* (60 minutes), and *not*
collaborative.  
Covers weeks 5, 6, and 7. Make sure you block out an hour of uninterrupted
time before you start the quiz - you can not pause the timer once you
start.

This week we are hitting some topics that are not
covered in the regular part of the book. It is more important than usual
that you check out the code samples in the Classroom slides section.

### Enums & Typedef

Read [learncpp.com's enum page](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/45-enumerated-types/) and
the book's [online enum supplement](http://liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/liang/cpp/supplement/Supplement4hEnumeratedTypes.pdf)

Read [leancpp.com's Typedef page](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/46-typedefs/)

This video adds a couple important points about enums and typedef's—watch it after reading the pages listed above:

Bit flags are a similar idea to enums—a way to represent multiple
options, but unlike enums, you can have a variable that is the
combination of two values. This video introduces the basic idea:

You can find a [bitflag tutorial here](http://forum.codecall.net/topic/56591-bit-fields-flags-tutorial-with-example/).
You do not need to become an expert with them, but definitely need
to recognize what is going on when you see code like BOLD | ITALIC.

### Structs

Read [learncpp.com's struct page](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/47-structs/)

These videos (and the accompanying slides and example code in the
Classroom Files link) introduce some concepts that are not covered
in the reading:

### Assignment

Start working on the assignment. Because this is the final assignment,
the deadline will work a little differently. You will have two weeks to
work on it, but no late work will be accepted (because the week after
that will be finals week).  This assignment does require a bit of work
to get set up and going, so be sure to start early.

### PhotoChop

I have introduced an extra credit assignment called PhotoChop, which
gives you a fun way to experiment with image manipulation and working
in a codebase that you didn't make yourself (which is what most programmers
spend most of their time doing). This assignment is due at the same time
as the regular assignment, and also will not be accepted late.
