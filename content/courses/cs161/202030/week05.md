## Online Activity Outline

Quiz 2 opens Thursday—it focuses on the material from weeks 3 & 4 (Ch
4.1-4.7 and Ch5), but concepts from the first weeks are likely to be
needed (variables, conditionals, etc...). Use the book author's website
to do some practice quiz questions as you work on the new material.

### Strings

Make sure you have done the strings material from the end of last
week. Then watch this video for some tips and tricks and read Ch
5.14:

You should at least be aware of why it isn't 100% correct to say
that .find() returns -1 when it can't find something in a string.
This video explains what is really going on—don't worry about
memorizing every detail, focus on identifying what is safe to do and
what is not.:

Do the CPPLab String Basics.

This video shows you how to use a loop to work your way through a
string:

Do the CPPLab String Loops.

### I/O Formating

Read Ch 4.10 on I/O formatting. This video explains the basics:

### FileIO

Read Ch 13.1-13.4 on Reading Writing Files. These videos introduce
file writing and reading:

{{< youtube videoid="Ks7kKSp3Ek8" title="File Reading" >}}

You don't need them for the assignment, but I highly recommend you
read 10.2.11 and 10.2.12—talks about how to use strings as a
stream (like a file you can read and write).

Take the quiz.

Do the assignment.

Midterm is next week\! Check the Files area for a sample midterm.
