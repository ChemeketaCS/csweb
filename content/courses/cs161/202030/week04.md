## Online Activity Outline

### Working on the Command Line

In parallel with the assignment, do the following activities to start
getting familiar with the command line. Before there were windows and
mice, the way we interacted with computers was all based on text input
into consoles (like the programs we are currently writing). Many tools
programmers use work on the command line (behind the scenes, QtCreator
is using text based commands to call the compiler) - learning to use the
command line is essential.

This video demonstrates the basics:

This [Command Line Guide](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/CSResources/CommandLineGuide.pdf)
provides detailed instructions for how to open a command prompt, set up the path, navigate, and
use g++. Using a QtCreator project, try building and running the code from the command prompt as
shown in the video.

For a more detailed treatment read either this [Windows command line guide (up to 2.6).](http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/CMD_Survival.html)
or this [Mac/Linux command line guide (up to 3.5)](http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Unix_SurvivalGuide.html).

### Loops

Read Ch 5.1-5.3. This video introduces the key ideas:

{{< youtube videoid="32gikxcH4Qk" title="While Loops" >}}

Do CPPLab Basic Loops.

Read Ch 5.4-5.5 and 5.6-5.9 and watch this video:

{{< youtube videoid="fhU_ZXwYTZA" title="Loop Strategies" >}}

Do CPPLab Loops 2.

Read Ch 5.10-5.13, 5.15 and watch this video:

{{< youtube videoid="efc37ke4DmQ" title="Nested Loops" >}}

Do Nested Loops CPPLab.

Read the rest of Ch 5.

Work on the assignment while you start preparing for next week by reading about strings below.

### String Intro

Read Ch 4.8 and 10.2 (you can stop at 10.2.10). Watch this video that introduces the basics:

{{< youtube videoid="dT-p6Dfl4e8" title="String Basics" >}}

Go look up string on [cplusplus.com](cplusplus.com) - use the search box at the top, and do
a search for "string". Then click on one of the functions, like "insert" and skim the
documentation. You need to start getting used to looking up things - most programmers do that
on the web instead of in textbooks, so start practicing\!

Do the StringPractice worksheet.  Like previous practice sheets, try to
predict the output for each statement then test it and see if you were correct.
