## Learning objectives

* Solve problems using a stack
* Implement an efficient stack or queue with a linked list or array
* Implement a heap using an array
* Reason about the efficiency of algorithms involving a heap

## Day 1

### Zoom Topics

* Midterm Debrief
* Assignment 3 Overview

* Watch this video on list iterators:
{{< youtube videoid="CGqMINzg674" >}}

* Read Liang Ch 20.5

* Do the LinkedList Iterators CPPLab. Don't overthink it. It should be the shortest CPPLab in terms
of lines of code you ever do.

## Day 2

* Watch this video on Stacks:
{{< youtube videoid="oqlTaleIzHs" >}}

* Read Liang Ch 12.4, 12.5, 12.9

* Watch this video on using a stack to convert infix to postfix notation:
{{< youtube videoid="HHCF0zS0HSc" >}}

* Do the InToPostFix Worksheet to practice using a stack to parse mathematical expressions.
There are extra examples available in the InfixToPostfixExamples.pdf in the Class Files link.

* The StackSamples project shows demonstration programs for parsing postfix expressions and for
parentheses checking. Make sure to check it out.

## Day 3

Queues

* Watch:
{{< youtube videoid="HHCF0zS0HSc" >}}

* Here is an [array based queue simulation you can try out](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/UCSFDataStructures/QueueArray.html)

* Read Ch 20.8

* Do the Queues CPPLab where you will implement the logic for an efficient array-based queue. There is a Queue WS in the files directory that has diagrams that might be helpful while you do the CPPLab problems.

## Day 4

### Zoom Topics

* Assignment 2 Debrief

Heaps

* Watch:
{{< youtube videoid="HHCF0zS0HSc" >}}

* Read Ch 19.6 - 19.6.4

* Do the Heap WS to practice adding and removing values from a heap by hand
Here is a [min heap simulation you can try out](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/UCSFDataStructures/Heap.html)

## Assignment 3

After completing Monday's material, are ready to do parts 1 and 2 of the assignment.
Part 3 you are already set to go on. Parts 4 and 5 depend on the logic you will implement in the
Heaps CPPLab later in the week
