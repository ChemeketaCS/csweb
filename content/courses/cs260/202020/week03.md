## Learning objectives

* Implement common operations, using either iteration or recursion, in a linked list
* Reason about the efficiency of algorithms working on a array based or linked list

## Day 1

### Zoom Topics

* Final assignment advice
* ArrayList review

Review Array Lists and Learn about Amortized Analysis

* Watch:

* Go back to week 7 of CS162 if you need/want more review on Array based Lists.

## Day 2

Start Linked Lists

* Watch these videos introducing a basic linked list and then some important additions we can make:

* Read Liang Ch20.0-20.4

* Do the LinkedList Worksheet. It has some pen and paper exercises as well as some link list diagrams
you can use for running code by hand as you figure out the CPPLabs.

Don't underestimate the power of drawing a diagram and running code by hand while you are trying
to understand or debug an algorithm. If you can't draw a diagram of a structure, you don't understand
it.

* Start the LinkedList CPPLab

## Day 3

Linked Lists Continued

* Watch this video on memory management in a linked list:
{{< youtube videoid="wcBDmCTJuCc" >}}

* And this video of tips on using the debugger with linked lists:
{{< youtube videoid="IhBhZS_eUq0" >}}

* Finish the LinkedList CPPLab

* Do the LinkedList - Memory CPPLab

## Day 4

### Zoom Topics

* LinkedList Debrief

Linked Lists With Recursion

* Watch this video:
{{< youtube videoid="htHbUrZtuMc" >}}

* Do the LinkedList - Recursion CPPLab.
I highly recommend drawing out some pictures while you work on the problems!
