## Learning objectives

* Implement common operations, using either iteration or recursion, in a linked list
* Reason about the efficiency of algorithms working on an array based or linked list

## Day 1


Circular Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists

* Watch this video on different kinds of linked lists:

* Read Liang Ch20.7

* Do the DLL Worksheet - it will help you think through the code you need for the CPPLabs.

* Do the DLL CPPLab

## Day 2

LinkedLists - slicing, splicing, and sorting

* Watch this video on sorting in linked lists. Sorting linked lists is nice, but what we really
care about here is how we do jobs differently in a linked list. Pay particular attention to how
slicing a list in half and and moving data from one list to another are done:

* Do the LinkedList Sorting CPPLab. The unit tests won't actually run the sort function that is
defined. But once you get the helpers (sliceInHalf, stealContents, and mergeInto) working, you
can write something simple to see that the sort function works if you like.

## Day 3

### Linked Lists vs Arrays

When should we use the different kinds of lists? Watch this video comparing Linked vs Array lists:

### Review

Check out the Midterm Study Guide from the Class Files link. It has some tips
on what to review and some practice questions.
