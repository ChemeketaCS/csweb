## The Work

### Worksheets, Programming Practice

You will be given problem sets to practice with concepts we are learning. This work is not
collected or graded, but is essential to perform well in the course.

### CPPLabs
These are programming practice assigned during each week. They are designed to get you to
tackle the material in manageable pieces at a steady pace. You can go back and work on the
labs at any time, but you will only
get points for work you did on a problem set before its due date.

You may work with other students on CPPLab problems. It is fine to
[collaborate](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/collaboration/)
in real time with other people.

CPPLab is graded on a very generous curve... I take the square root of the decimal percent
you earn on each assignment - that is your grade on the assignment.
(e.g. you solved 3 out of 4 problems. That would be 0.75, but I take square root to get .866 or 86.6%).
Your total score is the average of those "curved" scores. (i.e. you get 86.6% on one assignment
and 100% on the next, your average is 93.3%).

### Assignments
These are where you demonstrate your ability to apply what you are learning to solve problems.
The assignments for this class are of larger scale than those in CS161 or 162 - budgeting
time effectively and working well in advance of the due dates is essential.

Assignments generally have multiple parts and each one will print some output to demonstrate
that the code you wrote does the job it was supposed to. Code that does not run because of an
error in an earlier part of the assignment will likely be marked down as there is no proof
it works. If one part of your assignment causes a crash, do your best to comment it out so the
rest of your program can run and demonstrate that it works.

**Working Code > Code that mostly works > Commented out code > Code that crashes.**

Assignments that do not compile from the command line in the Chemeketa Development Environment
will not be scored.

You can turn in updated versions of assignments any time before the due date. If I see multiple
versions of an assignment,I will grade the one with the latest date on it.

Assignments should be your own work. You should not share your code with
others, or make use of code provided by other students. Nor should you submit
code you find on the internet. For information about how to get or give help
without violating this policy, see the [collaboration guide](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/collaboration/).

You receive three flex days to use as extensions on these assignments. If an assignment comes in
late, 1 day of late will be automatically used for each day or part of a day it is late.
Flex days used = (hours_late / 24.0) rounded up. You will not receive any grade penalty for
"flexed" assignments. Once your flex days are exhausted, you will not receive credit for late
work. Once you are nearing the deadline for an assignment, or into the flex zone, I strongly
encourage you to turn in an assignment that builds and completes just part of the requirements
rather than stressing out about completing every part of the assignment.

Assignments are generally graded and returned within one week of the due date. I use electronic
(eLearn) grading forms that are available for your review in the eLearn class site as soon as
your assignment is graded.

### Midterms and Final Exams

Make up/early exams are only allowed for students who have true emergencies or contact me
in advance about a scheduling conflict beyond their control.

## Student Collaboration

I encourage students to study together and talk about the material in the course. Students
are however responsible for doing their own work. Specific advice on what is considered
acceptable is available in the [collaboration guide](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/guides/collaboration/).
