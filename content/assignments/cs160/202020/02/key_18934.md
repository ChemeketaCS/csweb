1. See [the bits page from CS160Reader](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/Binary/Bits.html)
for a list of possibilities.

1. $\displaystyle 3\ megabytes\times \frac{1048576\ bytes}{1\ megabyte} \times
\frac{8\ bits}{1\ byte} = 25165824\ bits$

1. 
    1. You need 7 bits : 1000110
    1. 1023 (2^10 - 1)
