    1. I will use the **public key** of Amazon to encode a message.
      They will use their **private key** to decode it. They are
      the only ones with that key and thus the only ones who can read it.

    1. Apple *signs* (encrypts) the file with their **private key**.
    I use their **public key** to check the file. If it decodes, I know
    that Apple (only entity with the private key) must have sent it.

    by encrypting it with the authority's private key.

    1. The certificate authority's public key is built into my web browser (or system).
    I can use it to unlock the signed key to verify that the
    authority did in fact *sign* it.
