    1. 1,000,000,000 : n/2
    1. 2,000,000,000 : n
    1. 21 : log2(n)

1. D is Linear and E is Quadratic

    1. 164.928. Should compare 20,000,000 units of work to log2(20,000,000) units

1.  1. 0.4 * -3 + 1 * 2 = -1.2 + 2 = 0.8. That is below the threshold so 0.
    1. 0 * -2 (from Y1) + 0.6 * 0.5 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3. That is below the threshold so 0.
    1. **Decreases.** Increasing X increases the chance that Y1 is 1. When Y1 goes up it decreases the
    chance that the next neuron is on because it is weighted -2.
