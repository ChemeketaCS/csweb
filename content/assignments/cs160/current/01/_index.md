## Computer Fields & Careers

1. A friend is thinking about pursuing a career in computing. In your own words, use a sentence or two to describe what each field below would prepare them to do.
    1. Computer Science  
    1. Software Engineering  
    1. Computer Engineering  
    1. Information Technology  
    1. Information Systems  

1. For each of the fields above, what department at Chemeketa provides the most appropriate next step towards that field?

1. Explain what you think Edsger Dijkstra meant by his statement, “Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.”

## Programming

### Practice

Complete the programming tutorials that were assigned this week. This work will go in your
**Practice** grade.

{{% alert warning %}}
Common mistakes that will prevent you from getting credit for your work
include not setting your username in code.org correctly, working on the
wrong version of the material, or not signing up for the correct section.
Refer to the [code.org setup guide](/guides/code.org-setup/).

### Assignment Problems

These are a graded part of your assignment:

4. Using the work area for 3.4.3 (the first square problem), write code to make this pattern:  

    ![Sample rectangular spiral](sample.png)

    Copy and paste the **text version of your code** and a **screenshot of your drawing** into the assignment.
    You will need to hit the **Show Text** button to get the text version of your code that you can
    copy and paste:  

    ![The Code.org "Show Text" button](show_text.png)

    To find out how to take a screenshot of just a part of your screen, google
    *"Windows region screenshot"* or *"Mac region screenshot"*.
    I do NOT want screenshot of your entire screen - just the drawing.

Once you have received credit for a lesson in Code.org, you can't lose it. So don't worry about messing
up your code for 3.4.3. You can always use the **Version History** button to see your old code.

## Computer History

5. Why was the idea of a **Stored Program** a critical milestone in the development of computers?

1. For each of the four generations of computers, list the key technology used to build
the computers of that generation.

## Algorithm – Indexing

7. Build a page-word index (like the one shown in the reading or in Q8) for the words
*"student"*, *"computer"*, and *"monitors"* on the three pages shown below.  
    *Ignore capitalization and punctuation. Treat "Word", "word", and "word." as all the same.*

    **Page 1**

    >High schools often use hall monitors to make sure every student stays in class.

    **Page 2**

    >Computer monitors come in various sizes. Once very expensive, 20+ inch monitors are now common.

    **Page 3**

    >It is now often an expectation that every student has access to a computer.

1. Below is an index for a set of pages (NOT the same three pages shown above):

    | Word | Index |
    | --- | --- |
    | A | 1-2,  1-8,  1-12,  2-8,  3-15 |
    | bit | 1-7,  2-10 |
    | computer | 1-6, 1-19, 2-16,  3-4 |
    | dog | 2-2,  2-9,  3-16 |
    | man | 1-3,  3-2, 3-11 |
    | \<titleStart> | 1-1,  2-1,  3-1 |
    | \<titleEnd> | 1-4,  2-6,  3-5 |
    | \<bodyStart> | 1-5,  2-7,  3-6 |
    | \<bodyEnd> | 1-20,  2-17,  3-18 |

    Use it to answer these questions:

    1. What page would likely be the best match for a query about **"man"**? Why?

    1. What page(s) would be a match for the phrase **"dog bit"**? How do you know?

    1. What page(s) have the word **"A"** in the title? How do you know?

1. If the index contained pages only (as shown below), what is something we would
no longer be able to use it to do?

    | Word | Index |
    | --- | --- |
    | A | 1, 2, 3 |
    | bit | 1, 2|
    | ... | ... |
