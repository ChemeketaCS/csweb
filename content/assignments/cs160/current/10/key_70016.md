1. Assume the opposite is true: *There is a largest prime number*.

2. What happens if we feed the **Evil** program to itself? It asks Antivirus to look at Evil.
Antivirus either has to say yes or no.

    * If Antivirus says Yes, then Evil exits and does not infect the computer.
    But that contradicts the "Yes" from antivirus.

    * If Antivirus says No, then evil infects the computer. That contradicts the "No".  

    Either possible answer results in a contradiction. That antivirus program can't ever
    be made perfect.

1.  1. B is non-polynomial

    1. The work growns much slower as n gets larger. Example: When n is 100,
    $5n^2 = 5(100)^2 = 50,000$ but 
    $1.5^{100} = 4.07 \times 10^{17}$

1. $2^{50}$ or $1.13 \times 10^{15}$

1.  
    1. Factoring large numbers

    1. There are quantum algorithms that can solve this problem efficiently (in polynomial time)
