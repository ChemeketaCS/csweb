1.  Lots of possible answers, but must get two inputs (storing the first),
subtract one from the other, and then branch to either load 1 or load 0 and
then output.

2.  Translated:

    | Address   | Machine   Code   | Assembly   |
    |-  |-  |-  |
    | 0   | 901   | START   INP   |
    | 1   | 309   | STA   X   |
    | 2   | 208   | SUB   SECRET   |
    | 3   | 805   | BRP   EXIT   |
    | 4   | 600   | BRA   START   |
    | 5   | 508   | EXIT   LDA SECRET   |
    | 6   | 902   | OUT   |
    | 7   | 000   | HLT   |
    | 8   | 12   | SECRET   DAT 12   |
    | 9   | 0   | X   DAT 0   |

1.  
    1.  Tree should show C and E merging. Then A and the (C + E) merging.
    Then B and D merging. Then, (A + C + E) merging with (B + D).
    1.  Final code should look something like:  
        A: 10  
        B: 01  
        C: 111  
        D: 00  
        E: 110

1. Lossy compression. We can throw out some of the details and get back to an image that
is "close enough" to the original.
