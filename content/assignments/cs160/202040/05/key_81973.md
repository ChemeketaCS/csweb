2. Secondary is slow, but is large and persists when the computer is off. Main memory
    is much faster, but is smaller and disappears when the power is off.

    1.  Translation:

        | Address   | Value   | Description  |
        |-  |-  |-  |
        | 0   | 901   | Get input (x) |
        | 1   | 310   | Store x to location 10 |
        | 2   | 901   | Get input (y) |
        | 3   | 110   | Add the value at 10 (x) to y, sets acc to x + y |
        | 4   | 310   | Store x + y to location 10 |
        | 5   | 110   | Add value from location 10 (x + y) to the x + y we already have and get 2(x + y) |
        | 6   | 902   | Output 2(x + y) |
        | 7   | 0   | Halt |

    1. 2(x + y) or 2x + 2y

5. Many possible answers, but you have to have these elements:  

    * Get an input and store it (x)
    * Get a second input (y) and store it
    * Use adds to make 3y using stored value of y
    * Subtract stored value of x from the total

6. Requires lots more overhead (extra information) to do the trick.
    Both tricks can be fooled by too many errors, so that is not a comparative advantage.

1. Should interpret it as **0110**. You are looking for something that is only off by one bit.
    The encoding for 0110 is 0110010 which is only one bit off from **1**110010.

    1. Checksum is 2 (4 + 6 + 7 + 5 = 22, last digit is 2)
    1. Varies
    1. 4 * 1 + 6 * 2 + 7 * 3 + 5 * 4 = 57, so check sum is 7
    1. Unless you got really (un??)lucky with your errors in part B, the checksum for part D should not
        match part C.

1.  
    1. Look for what row and column the checksums do not work for. In this problem that is 
        row 3 and column 1. So the **5** at row 3, col 1 must be an error.

    1. The checksums for the row and column with the error are both off by 3. So we need to change
        the incorrect value by 3:

        8 3 2  
        6 5 1  
        **2** 4 9
