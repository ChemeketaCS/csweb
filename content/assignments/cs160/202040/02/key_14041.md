## Selected Answers for Assignment 2

1. The red line shows the binary signal that results from applying the
threshold (dotted line) to the analog signal (gray line). This process
cleans up the "noise" associated with the messy analog signal to produce
either a 0 or 1.

1. See [the bits page from CS160Reader](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/Binary/Bits.html)
for a list of possibilities.

1. $\displaystyle 3\ megabytes\times \frac{1048576\ bytes}{1\ megabyte} \times
\frac{8\ bits}{1\ byte} = 25165824\ bits$

1. 
    1. You need 7 bits : 1000110
    1. 1023 (2^10 - 1)


1. Should end up with 10101:
    
    | Number   |    | Quotient   | Remainder   | Answer   |
    |-  |-  |-  |-  |-  |
    | 21   | / 2 =    | 10   | 1   |     1   |
    | 10   | / 2 =   | 5   | 0   |    01   |
    | 5   | / 2 =   | 2   | 1   |   101   |
    | 2   | / 2 =   | 1   | 0   |  0101   |
    | 1   | / 2 =    | 0   | 1   | 10101   |

6. Page 4. It has two incoming links AND gets all the traffic from both 5 and 6 (not that 6 is that
popular). Page 5 has two incoming links and is almost as popular, but it only gets half
of the traffic from 4 while 4 gets all the traffic from 5.

1. Pages 7, 2, and 4. Page 0 directly feeds 2 and 7, while the increased traffic to 2 also
sends more to page 4.

1. The random restart chance.
