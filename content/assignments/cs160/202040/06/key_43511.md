5. Something quite compressed like: (12)0 (4)110011  

    A "not very compressed" answer might look like: 
    (1)000000000000
    (2)1 (2)0 (2)1
    (2)1 (2)0 (2)1
    (2)1 (2)0 (2)1
    (2)1 (2)0 (2)1

    1.  Final code should look something like:  
        D: 0  
        A: 100  
        E: 101  
        B: 110  
        C: 111
