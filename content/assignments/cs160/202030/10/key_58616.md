1. Assume the opposite is true: *There is a largest prime number*.

2. What happens if we feed the **Evil** program to itself? It asks Antivirus to look at Evil.
Antivirus either has to say yes or no.

    * If Antivirus says Yes, then Evil exits and does not infect the computer.
    But that contradicts the "Yes" from antivirus.

    * If Antivirus says No, then evil infects the computer. That contradicts the "No".  

    Either possible answer results in a contradiction. That antivirus program can't ever
    be made perfect.

1.  1. A is non-polynomial

    1. The work growns much slower as n gets larger. Example: When n is 20,
    $n! = 2432902008176640000$ but 
    $n^3 = 8000$

1. $2^{64}$ or $1.84 \times 10^{19}$

1. There are quantum algorithms that can factor large numbers efficiently
(in polynomial time). That is a difficult task for traditional computers. RSA
relies on the fact that factoring is hard for security, so quantum computers
could make it much easier to break RSA encryption.
