## Selected Answers for Assignment 2

1. The red line shows the binary signal that results from applying the
threshold (dotted line) to the analog signal (gray line). This process
cleans up the "noise" associated with the messy analog signal to produce
either a 0 or 1.

1. See [the bits page from CS160Reader](http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/cs160Reader/Binary/Bits.html)
for a list of possibilities.

1. $\displaystyle 5\ kilbytes\times \frac{1024\ bytes}{1\ kilobyte} \times
\frac{8\ bits}{1\ byte} = 40960\ bits$

1. 
    1. You need 6 bits : 110010
    1. 32,767 (2^15 - 1)


1. Should end up with 10101:
    
    | Number   |    | Quotient   | Remainder   | Answer   |
    |-  |-  |-  |-  |-  |
    | 38   | / 2 =    | 19   | 0   |      0   |
    | 19   | / 2 =   | 9   | 1   |     10   |
    | 9   | / 2 =   | 4   | 1   |    110   |
    | 4   | / 2 =   | 2   | 0   |   0110   |
    | 2   | / 2 =    | 1   | 0   |  00110   |
    | 1   | / 2 =    | 0   | 1   | 100110   |

6. Page 0 is the least popular. Only Page 1 links to it but Page 1 also links to Page 2.
Lots of traffic will bounce back and forth between 1 and 2.

1. It will need to do a **random restart** where it randomly picks a new page to start the
process over from.

1. Page 5 contributes the most. It has the highest rating itself of those three.  
Page 0 contributes the least. It has the same rating as Page 1, but the traffic from
it goes to both 7 and 2 whereas Page 1 sends all of its traffic to 2.
