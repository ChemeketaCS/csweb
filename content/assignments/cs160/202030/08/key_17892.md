1.  
    1. 300,000 : n/2  
    1. 600,000 : n
    1. 20 : log2(n)  (19.19... have to round that up)

1. D is Linear and E is Quadratic

1.  
    1.  Should compare 3,000,000 units of work for linear search (an O(n) algorithm) to log2(2000000)
    units for binary search.  
    $\frac{log{2}(3,000,000)}{3,000,000} = \frac{0.0002}{x} => log{2}(3,000,000)x = 600 => x = 27.9 seconds$

    1.  Should compare 50,000^2 units of work to 120,000^2 units since selection sort is an n^2 algorithm.  
    $\frac{50,000^2}{120,000^2} = \frac{4.1}{x} => 2500000000x = 5.904 \times 10^{12} => x = 2361.6$


1.  1. Studio
    1. Independent
    1. The one nearest data point might be a fluke. In this case, although there is one studio
    movie with low sales and middle ratings, most of the movies that have low sales and middling
    ratings are independent.

1.  1. Is it a comedy - the first decision point.
    1. No, all 4 shows that are comedies and do not have guns were liked.
        Knowing about lawyers will not help us refine our guess.
    1. Probably will be liked. There are 6 comedies. 4 were liked, 2 were not.

1.  1. 0.9 * -1 + 0.3 * 4 + 0.6 * 3 = -0.9 + 1.2 + 1.8 = 2.1
    1. 0 or something clost to it. 2.1 is is below the threshold of 3

1. Machine learning is used. The neural network is presented with training data and the
weights are adjusted to make its predictions match that data.
