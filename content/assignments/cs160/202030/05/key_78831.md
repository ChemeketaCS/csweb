2. Secondary is slow, but is large and persists when the computer is off. Main memory
    is much faster, but is smaller and disappears when the power is off.

    1.  Translation:

        | Address   | Value   | Description  |
        |-  |-  |-  |
        | 0   | 901   | Get input (x)   |
        | 1   | 310   | Store x to location 10   |
        | 2   | 110   | Add value from 10 (x) to the x we have. Get 2x   |
        | 3   | 310   | Store 2x to location 10   |
        | 4   | 901   | Get input (y)   |
        | 5   | 110   | Add value from 10 (2x) to the y we have. Get y + 2x   |
        | 6   | 311   | Store y + 2x to location 11   |
        | 7   | 111   | Add value from 11 (y + 2x) to the y + 2x we have. Get 2y + 4x   |
        | 8   | 902   | Print 2y + 4x   |
        | 9   | 0   | Halt   |

    1. 2(y + 2x) or 2y + 4x

5. Many possible answers, but you have to have these elements:  

    * Get an input and store it (x)
    * Get a second input (y) and store it
    * Subtract stored value of x twice (or calculate 2x and store that then subtract)

6. Requires lots more overhead (extra information) to do the trick.
    Both tricks can be fooled by too many errors, so that is not a comparative advantage.

1. Should interpret it as **0010**. You are looking for something that is only off by one bit.
    The encoding for 0010 is 0010111 which is only one bit off from 00**0**0111

    1. Checksum is 1 (3 + 9 + 2 + 7 = 21, last digit is 1)
    1. Varies
    1. 3 * 1 + 9 * 2 + 2 * 3 + 7 * 4 = 55, so check sum is 5
    1. Unless you got really (un??)lucky with your errors in part B, the checksum for part D should not
        match part C.

1.  
    1. Look for what row and column the checksums do not work for. In this problem that is 
        row 3 and column 1. So the **5** at row 3, col 1 must be an error.

    1. The checksums for the first column and middle row are both off by 3.
    So the first item in the middle row must be changed by 3:

        3 4 5  
        **6** 2 6  
        7 9 8
