title: Final project
summary: Revisit and expand
---

For your final project, go back to a previous assignment and make a
final-project-worthy version of it.  Do something beyond it that wasn't
asked for, and that you didn't already do. If you thought of a cool
way to follow up on your own work at the time, or you weren't able to
accomplish the best version of what you had in mind, do it now!  If,
looking back from the end of the term, you see a subject in a new light
and want to explore it in a different way than you did before, great!
If you had a favorite project that really stood out from the others,
look at it again and see how you can get back into it.

If you aren't sure whether you have thought of something that is
significant enough to count while still being achievable, by all means
run your idea by me. I'd be happy to give you feedback as you plan or
while you work. Here are some links to previous assignments and some
thoughts about how one might extend them, but you don't have to limit
yourself to the options I've thought of!

- [Logic gates]({{< ref "gates" >}})

  You might make a set of gates using a totally different medium, or
  make a kind of gate that wasn't included before, or make a circuit
  that composes a few gates connected together.

- [Meaningful data]({{< ref "meaningfuldata" >}})

  You might make a more permanent work of art, or a significantly
  longer message.

- [Questions]({{< ref "questions" >}})

  You might write a short essay with cited research that answers one or
  more of the questions we raised.

- [Simulator]({{< ref "simulator" >}})

  You might add another feature to the CPU that you didn't tackle before,
  or a more challenging one like making the control unit microcoded,
  or make your own CPU or calculator.

- [Primes]({{< ref "primes" >}})

  You might make assembly versions to compare and contrast the algorithm
  I gave you with the [Sieve of Eratosthenes], or you might make a
  different assembly program of comparable size and difficulty to the
  original assignment.

    [Sieve of Eratosthenes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

- [Smashing the stack]({{< ref "stack" >}})

  You might look into modern stack-smashing attacks, and see how the arms race
  has advanced past the protections we had to turn off for our original assignment. (From a quick look around google, [this might be an interesting tutorial].)

Post all relevant materials, pictures, documentation, source, etc. so
that we can appreciate what you have done. Have a look around and comment
on other people's projects. Be creative, and have fun!
