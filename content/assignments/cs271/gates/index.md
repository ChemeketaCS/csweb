title: Logic Gates
summary: Build hands-on mechanical logic gates.

---

Your challenge is to build a physical incarnation of three fundamental
components of digital logic: an AND gate, an OR gate, and a NOT gate.
By the due date, you must post in the discussion thread for this
assignment, with pictures and/or videos showing your gates in all of
their states.  You do not need to have all three gates exist at the
same time; you are allowed to document one and reuse the materials to
build the next one.  Your post must explain how to interpret the inputs
of each gate, the outputs of each gate, the representation of true and
false, and the operation of the mechanism. There are many different ways
to proceed, and they are all good. Be as creative as you like or just
build your own implementation of something you see below.  If you have
a specific idea you want to run by me, I would be happy to help.

One of my personal favorite designs uses [mechanical linkages] and
includes a list of many other sources of inspiration, which I have also
incorporated here. Another impressive set of linkage gates can be found,
with videos and a simulated adder, on [Xiaoji's design blog].  I also
found an excellent [academic paper on linkage gates], and another one
by the same authors on [microflexural gates].

Another project [uses Legos], and gets as far as an adder, a flip flop,
and clocked logic, and then does it all over again with rotational
rather than push-pull interpretations of bits. Another set of [Lego
gates] comes from CMU. Here's a [Lego XOR gate]. This [universal gate]
can be easily reconfigured to represent AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, or XNOR.

Nanotechnology is one of the main application areas of mechanical logic,
and there is an article that presents [two ideas] in that vein.

If you have the ability and the resources, you might play with 3D
printing. Here's a [3D-printed AND gate].

This one doesn't come with a lot of explanation, but it seems to be a
sliding [paper-and-wire NAND gate].

Some very esoteric possibilities are out there, from the [eye computer]
to the use of [live crabs].  One way to think about inventing your
own sort of gates could be to learn how [gates are normally built from
transistors], and find some way to build a mechanical transistor.

And, last but not least, there are [pulleys and weights].  One of
the best-known physical interpretations of digital logic comes from a
Scientific American article from April Fool's Day 1988, describing the
pulley logic of the fictional [Apraphulian culture].

Remember, these were written for a variety of different audiences. If
some of them seem too hard or too easy for you, think about who the
author was targetting and get out of it what you can. In particular,
one of the most important lessons I ever learned was not to be afraid
of material that seemed too technicalâ€”it usually turns out to have
a simple lesson hidden behind what seemed hard, and, particularly when
you have help (me!), you can dig out that simple lesson and use it.

Most of all, have fun! Your job isn't to impress me or understand every
resource I've thrown at you, it's to get a hands-on understanding of
the building blocks of computing.
