summary: Explore the space of computer architecture through questions

---

Write down four questions you have about computer architecture, computer
organization, or computer systems.

They can be in the form of questions, or they can be in the form of
statements you'd like to understand better. They can be long or short. You
can already think you know a little about the answer.

You might want to know what a term you've heard means. You might want
to know how something you've used is made. You might want to invite
speculation about future trends. You might want to fact-check a rumor or
marketing you've heard. You might want to discuss a computer thing you saw
in a movie. Your question might be something another student knows the
answer to, or something I  know the answer to, or even something nobody
in our class knows the answer to. You might worry that it's something
everyone but you knows the answer to. As long as it is related to the
subject of the class and you care about the answer, it's a good question.

When you have collected your questions, submit them in text or PDF format
to elearn.  I will collate and edit all of the submissions, and then
post a list of them.  Your individual question might appear or might be
edited to combine it with similar questions; I might rephrase questions;
I reserve the right to leave a submission out, such as in the case that
it seems inappropriate or off-topic. I will not attach anyone's names
or identities to any of the questions.
