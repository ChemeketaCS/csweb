title: Meaningful Data
summary: Represent a piece of data that is meaningful to you

---

Make a physical object that represents a piece of information that
is meaningful to you. Think about all of the kinds of data we have
discussed representing:

* integers
* floating point numbers
* colors
* ASCII
* Unicode, including many writing systems and emoji
* geographical coordinates
* dates and times
* etc.

Choose one piece of data that has some meaning to you and that can be
represented in a practical number of bits. Then, choose a way to represent
bits physically. There are many ways, and I won't try to list them all,
but to give you a sense of what I'm talking about, I could see using:

* strings of beads of different colors or sizes
* cross-stitch
* arrangement of pieces on a game board
* [knotting patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu)
* weaving
* etc.

Be creative! The representation may be a permanent object you can
keep after this class, or it may be ephemeral, constructed only for
this assignment and then disassembled again. You may choose physical
symbols for 0 and 1 and represent your data in binary, or, if it helps,
you may choose 16 different symbols and represent represent the same
bits in hexadecimal, which might make it practical to represent more
information. Whatever you represent should be something you care about.

You will submit pictures and a description of your object. Your
explanation must include how to interpret the physical object as a string
of bits, and how to interpret the string of bits as a representation
of your data. If you want, you may explain the significance of what you
chose to represent, but you don't have to.
