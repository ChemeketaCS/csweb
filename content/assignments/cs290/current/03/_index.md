## Goals

* Conduct an accessibility audit and design with accessibility in mind 
* Use Bootstrap to assist with layout and style

## Overview

Continue working in the `aboutme` directory.

You should do the accessibility audit on the version of your pages you turned in for week 2. If you
do the Bootstrap work first, use git to "time travel" back to the pre Bootstrap version of your pages.

The accessibility audit you will submit as a PDF.

You will also need to describe the work you do for  parts of the assignment. This should be submitted
as a separate document from the accessibility audit.

## Accessibility Audit

Complete an accessibility audit of your work on assignment 1 and 2.

[Accessibility Audit Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bp3t2i_kt24Ktbf1ckuKZL3QWaj2FiM-9WJHzBedxRk/copy)

You can receive full credit even if there are issues at this stage as long as you document
and explain them where required.

## Accessibility Improvements

Fix any issues identified in your audit.

Then, mark up your table to improve its accessibility. Add a `caption` to the table and
`scope` attributes to all `th` tags.

You can find good examples of using these tags here:
https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/

**Writeup Question #1:** Briefly describe what fixes you made. Use a list instead of a paragraph.

## Bootstrap

Modify your webpages to make use of Bootstrap. As part of doing this, you may want to
remove some of your old style rules.

You should make use of Bootstrap to style some of the following features.

* The nav menu on each page
* Your images
* The table on your coursework page
* Layout of one or more pages using Bootstrap's grid

**Writeup Question #2:** Briefly describe what changes, what features of Bootstrap you incorporated
into your project.
