## Goal

Style webpages using CSS.

## Requirements

Continue working in the `aboutme` directory. You will almost
certainly need to add new HTML or modify what you did in assignment 1 in order to do this
assignment.

CSS rules should use classes and IDs to target elements in a logical and consistent fashion.
Your classes and IDs should all have meaningful names. Any interesting "block" of HTML should
have either a class and/or ID so it can be targetted.

For one part of this assignment, you will need to describe what you did in a PDF you will
submit to elearn. Use google docs or Word to make a document and then save it as a PDF to submit.

This is not a graphic design course, you do not need to make beautiful pages to receive full
credit. The goal is clean and reasonably attractive pages with well structured HTML that an
actual designer could easily work with.

### Common Elements

Style your navigation links into some kind of navigation menu that is visually distinct from the
rest of the page. (Background, border, different font color, etc...)

Style your footer to be visually distinct from the main part of the page.

Pick a web font or two (https://fonts.google.com/) to use across all of your pages. You can use your
custom font for either all the text, just headers, or for some other logical purpose.

### Home

Improve the styling and layout of this page. In particular, do something to make one or all of the
"chunks" visually stand out from the page. Borders, backgrounds, etc...

Arrange the chunks so that they are not all just stacked vertically. (Some are side by side or
floating or nested within some container.)

### Hobby/Interest

Style the captions/titles for your images and lay them out so they obviously "go with" the images.

Use flexbox or float or widths to do something interesting with the layout of the images and text.

Style all the links to use some custom color.

### Coursework

Make the table more visually interesting and easier to "read". Give the top/and or
left headers distinct styling.

### Responsiveness

Your pages should look clean in both a computer and mobile sized window. Use `@media` queries,
flexbox, etc... to customize the layout on different sized screens.

For full credit, there should be obvious layout changes based on screen size. (Nav menu moves
from side to top, images go from floating on the side of the page to being full width, etc...).

Simply avoiding obvious issues on both large and small screens without actually fundamentally
changing the layout is partial credit.

**Writeup Question #1:** Briefly describe what you made responsive and the technology you used
to do so. What issues did you have to fix? What did you do layout wise?

## Scoring Overview

Common elements - 15 pts
: 

Home - 10 pts
: 

Hobby/Interest page - 10 pts
: 

Coursework page - 5 pts
: 

Responsiveness - 5 pts
: (You can earn 3 pts simply for lack of any issues at different display widths)
Must have writeup to receive any credit.

Class/ID use - 5 pts
: Clean and logical system for labeling/targeting elements. It would be easy for a designer
to come in and style the code you produced.
